  <h2>FE000000 Guide</h2>
  <h3>~r getRandomMessage() ~</h3>
  <p>This guide divides the game into pieces based on which of the ~i 16 ~ goals in the "Goals" tab have been accomplished so far.</p>
  <h3>Before sacrifice</h3>
  <p>This part of the game is fairly simple. Start by clicking the "Main" button to go to the main tab, if you haven't already. Then buy a Generator 1 for the cost of ~i 2 ~ stars. Other generators will become affordable over time. You can hold down M to buy max of all generators. The way generators work is very simple. Each generator produces the one before it, except the first which produces stars. Buying more of a generator increases a multiplier to its production.</p>
  <p>It doesn't matter very much in what order you buy generators, but generally buying a generator you don't have any of is best, and otherwise lower generators are better than higher ones. Buying max will generally automatically buy generators in this order.</p>
  <p>The autobuyer tab is also useful at this point. You can buy "slow" autobuyers for stars, and hey will each automatically buy a certain generator every ~i 16 ~ seconds (which is why they are called "slow"). They are automatically set to buy max, and you should probably keep them there because then, if they can buy more than ~i 1 ~ of a generator when they trigger, they will do so (if set to buy singles they will only buy ~i 1 ~). You should generally buy an autobuyer as soon as you have bought all generators with the same price or a lower price.</p>
  <p>Once you get ~i Math.pow(2, 64) ~ stars, several things will happen more or less at once. Firstly, you can buy the last generator, your first Generator 8. There is no Generator 9, so this is somewhat significant. Secondly, you can buy a boost. This will multiply all your generator multipliers by ~i 2 ~ when bought. Thirdly, after buying Generator 8, you will be able to sacrifice. It doesn't matter very much for what multiplier you do this the first time, but I would recommend at least ~i 4 ~x, and getting the boost with cost ~i Math.pow(2, 64) ~ stars.</p>
  <h3>Sacrifice to prestige</h3>
  <p>So, you've sacrificed. This resets all Generator 1-7 amounts, but they keep their multipliers, and Generator 8 actually has a slightly increased (~i 4 ~x) multiplier. Thus, it should only take about a minute for you to get back to the same star production you had before. After this, keep playing as before. There'll be another boost at ~i Math.pow(2, 100) ~ stars.</p>
  <p>At ~i Math.pow(2, 128) ~ stars, you will be able to prestige. The slow Generator 8 autobuyer also costs ~i Math.pow(2, 128) ~ stars, so unless you're very active you probably want to buy that autobuyer first. However, after buying that, prestige as soon as you can.</p>
  <h3>Prestige to infinity</h3>
  <p>So, you've prestiged. This resets all Generator 1-8 amounts and multipliers, and your stars. However, you now have a roughly ~i 4 ~x multiplier to all generators, which will let you get far more quickly to where you were before. You also keep your slow autobuyers. Keep playing as before, perhaps sacrificing slightly later, at perhaps ~i 6 ~x (though it barely matters). Eventually you'll be able to prestige again. I'm not sure what multiplier is best to prestige for the second time, but consistently prestiging for ~i 4 ~x is not that bad. If you prestiged for ~i 4 ~x the first time, you should be able to prestige for ~i 4 ~x again at ~i Math.pow(2, 160) ~ stars, though it might be worth pushing a little further to unlock the slow boost autobuyer, the last slow autobuyer, for ~i Math.pow(2, 162) ~ stars.</p>
  <p>Note that prestige power gain (and sacrifice multiplier gain, for that matter) is based on stars, so buying something right before prestiging or sacrificing can cause less of a benefit than you might hope. If you care about this, you might want to turn autobuyers off directly before each sacrifice or prestige, just to be safe.</p>
  <p>Keep prestiging for roughly ~i 4 ~x (or whatever). If you're close to ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ stars (if you have more than ~i Math.pow(2, 248) ~, perhaps) it's probably best not to prestige, because stuff happens at ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ stars. Specifically, stars will stop increasing. Also, the main tab will vanish, and be replaced with a message saying "The universe has collapsed due to an excess of stars." (I guess that's why stars stopped increasing.) Also, a new button will appear, saying "Infinity: Gain 2 infinity points", with additional statistics on it. Press this button, and infinity, as soon as it appears; unlike with sacrifice and prestige, there's nothing to be gained from waiting at this point.</p>
