    <h3>Before sacrifice</h3>
    <p>This part of the game is fairly simple. Start by clicking the "Main" button to go to the main tab, if you haven't already. Then buy a Generator 1 for the cost of ~i 2 ~ stars. Other generators will become affordable over time. You can hold down M to buy max of all generators. The way generators work is very simple. Each generator produces the one before it, except the first which produces stars. Buying more of a generator increases a multiplier to its production, by ~f Math.pow(2, 1 / 8) ~x per purchase.</p>
    <p>Generator inital costs: ~i 2 ~^(generator number^~i 2 ~) stars</p>
    <p>Generator cost increases per purchase: (~i 2 ~^generator number)x stars</p>
    <p>It doesn't matter very much in what order you buy generators, but generally buying a generator you don't have any of is best, and otherwise lower generators are better than higher ones. Buying max will generally automatically buy generators in this order.</p>
    <p>The autobuyer tab is also useful at this point. You can buy "slow" autobuyers for stars, and hey will each automatically buy a certain generator every ~ti 16 ~ (which is why they are called "slow"). They are automatically set to buy max, and you should probably keep them there because then, if they can buy more than ~i 1 ~ of a generator when they trigger, they will do so (if set to buy singles they will only buy ~i 1 ~). You should generally buy an autobuyer as soon as you have bought all generators with the same price or a lower price.</p>
    <p>Once you get ~i Math.pow(2, 64) ~ stars, several things will happen more or less at once. Firstly, you can buy the last generator, your first Generator 8. There is no Generator 9, so this is somewhat significant. Secondly, you can buy a boost. This will multiply all your generator multipliers by ~i 2 ~ when bought. Thirdly, after buying Generator 8, you will be able to sacrifice. It doesn't matter very much for what multiplier you do this the first time, but I would recommend at least ~i 4 ~x, and getting the boost with cost ~i Math.pow(2, 64) ~ stars.</p>
  </tab>
  <tab ~style.display=Tabs.currentTab() === 2 ? '' : 'none'~>
    <h3>Sacrifice to prestige</h3>
    <p>So, you've sacrificed. This resets all Generator 1-7 amounts, but they keep their multipliers, and Generator 8 actually has a slightly increased (~i 4 ~x) multiplier. Thus, it should only take about ~ts 60 ~ for you to get back to the same star production you had before. After this, keep playing as before. There'll be another boost at ~i Math.pow(2, 100) ~ stars. Note that in general boosts are the most worthwhile things to buy, since they give a multiplier to all generators.</p>
    <p>Sacrifice formula: (log(stars when sacrificing, ~i 2 ~) / ~i 16 ~) sacrifice multiplier</p>
    <p>At ~i Math.pow(2, 128) ~ stars, you will be able to prestige. The slow Generator 8 autobuyer also costs ~i Math.pow(2, 128) ~ stars, so unless you're very active you probably want to buy that autobuyer first. However, after buying that, prestige as soon as you can.</p>
  </tab>
  <tab ~style.display=Tabs.currentTab() === 3 ? '' : 'none'~>
    <h3>Prestige to infinity</h3>
    <p>So, you've prestiged. This resets all Generator 1-8 amounts and multipliers, and your stars. However, you now have a roughly ~i 4 ~x multiplier to all generators, which will let you get far more quickly to where you were before. You also keep your slow autobuyers. Keep playing as before, perhaps sacrificing slightly later, at perhaps ~i 6 ~x (though it barely matters). Eventually you'll be able to prestige again. I'm not sure what multiplier is best to prestige for the second time, but consistently prestiging for ~i 4 ~x is not that bad. If you prestiged for ~i 4 ~x the first time, you should be able to prestige for ~i 4 ~x again at ~i Math.pow(2, 160) ~ stars, though it might be worth pushing a little further to unlock the slow boost autobuyer, the last slow autobuyer, for ~i Math.pow(2, 162) ~ stars.</p>
    <p>Prestige formula: (stars when sacrificing^~f 1 / 16 ~ / ~i 64 ~) prestige power</p>
    <p>Note that prestige power gain (and sacrifice multiplier gain, for that matter) is based on stars, so buying something right before prestiging or sacrificing can cause less of a benefit than you might hope. If you care about this, you might want to turn autobuyers off directly before each sacrifice or prestige, just to be safe.</p>
    <p>Keep prestiging for roughly ~i 4 ~x (or whatever). Sacrifice once in each prestige, ~ts 120 ~ to ~ts 300 ~ after prestiging (or when progress feels like it's starting to slow). If you're close to ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ stars (if you have more than ~i Math.pow(2, 248) ~, perhaps) it's probably best not to prestige, because stuff happens at ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ stars. Specifically, stars will stop increasing. Also, the main tab will vanish, and be replaced with a message saying "The universe has collapsed due to an excess of stars." (I guess that's why stars stopped increasing.) Also, a new button will appear, saying "Infinity: Gain 2 infinity points", with additional statistics on it. Press this button, and infinity, as soon as it appears; unlike with sacrifice and prestige, there's nothing to be gained from waiting at this point.</p>
  </tab>
  <tab ~style.display=Tabs.currentTab() === 4 ? '' : 'none'~>
    <h3>Infinity to breaking infinity</h3>
    <p>So, you've infinitied. This resets everything prestige resets, and also resets prestige power. However, you keep your slow autobuyers. New tabs called "Infinity" and "Challenges" also unlock. On the Infinity tab, you can see that you have ~i 2 ~ infinity points and ~i 1 ~ infinity (infinities are basically a count of how many times you've infinitied). Buy an Infinity Generator 1 for the ~i 2 ~ infinity points you just got. Note that infinity generators (IGs) have the same initial costs, cost increases, and multiplier per purchase as the generators you already know from pre-infinity (for clarity, in this guide the pre-infinity generators are sometimes called normal generators, though sometimes they are called generators when it is (hopefully) clear); they just cost IP instead of stars. Infinity will reset infinity stars to ~i 1 ~ infinity generator amounts to however many you've bought, but will not reset their multipliers.</p>
    <p>There will be something on the autobuyer tab that appears to let you turn the infinity autobuyer on (checked) or off (unchecked). It indeed does, but since the infinity autobuyer is locked it doesn't do anything whether it's on or off yet. It doesn't really matter whether you turn it on or off right now; by the time you unlock it you'll be changing its other settings a lot too. In general, if an autobuyer does something that resets things in the way that (as you just saw) infinity does, it will be possible to turn it off before unlocking it, so it doesn't reset things right after it's unlocked and before it can be turned off. This is also why the above "Turn newly unlocked autobuyers on when unlocked" setting exists.</p>
    <p>Do another infinity, following the parts of the guide above this (except that you don't need to unlock slow autobuyers, since they're already unlocked). It'll be a lot quicker (probably at least ~i 4 ~x quicker), since you'll have a ~i 1.5 ~x multiplier to normal generators from having produced ~i 2 ~ infinity points (the formula for this multiplier is (~i 1 ~ + total infinity points / ~i 4 ~), capped at ~i 16 ~), and there'll be an increasing multiplier to normal generators from infinity stars, produced by your Infinity Generator 1. Due to this infinity being quicker, you don't need to wait as long to sacrifice; generally you should sacrifice once each prestige, when the number of stars you need to prestige is roughly ~i Math.pow(2, 32) ~x your current stars.</p>
    <p>After you infinity for the second time, you'll have ~i 2 ~ unspent infinity points, which you can't buy anything with. Do the same thing again but slightly quicker. Now the multiplier from total IP is ~i 2 ~x and since you have ~i 2 ~ infinities rather than ~i 1 ~, infinity stars will be produced ~i 2 ~x faster (infinity generators are all multiplied by min(~i 1 ~, infinities / ~i 256 ~), meaning that more infinities make them stronger up to ~i 256 ~), giving roughly a ~f Math.sqrt(2) ~x additional multiplier to generators. After you infinity for the third time, you'll have ~i 4 ~ IP and be able to buy Infinity Generator 1 again. Now you're ready to start doing challenges.</p>
    <p>Challenges are much like normal infinities, but they have special conditions to make them harder and give you an autobuyer (or make one of your autobuyers trigger every tick) on completion. Also, all generators are multiplied by ~i 2 ~^(completed challenges / ~i 4 ~). To do a challenge, go to the Challenges tab and click its "Start challenge" button. In theory any of the challenges could be done immediately, but some are much easier than others. Also, some challenges (2 and 12) start out similar to a normal infinity and don't get easier as you progress by as much as the other challenges. These are marked with "Consistent" because they take a more consistent amount of time with progress than the others. I found them hard but apparently other people don't.</p>
    <p>Below is information on each challenge (including strategy for each challenge), followed by a description of general strategy.</p>
    <p>Challenge 1: Easy. It's not faster than a normal infinity overall, but it's close. After you have ~i 1 ~ of each generator the only generators worth buying are Generator 1 and (to a small extent) Generator 8. If you're fairly active, you might want to turn some of your autobuyers off and buy Generators 1 and 8 manually due to this. (Boosts are still worth buying though.) Also, don't sacrifice in this challenge because it's useless.</p>
    <p>Challenge 2: Consistent. This challenge is somewhat slow, and doesn't speed up as much with progress as normal infinities and most challenges do. The important thing for this challenge is not to be buying things constantly (so you can't always be buying max), because buying almost anything resets the generator multipliers and they take a while to recover. At this point, buying things roughly every ~ti 16 ~ is good. You can do Challenge 2 very early if you want (buying things less frequently, maybe even only once per minute). You can buy things on some interval by setting autobuyers to trigger every ~ti 16 ~ (in which case you probably want to synchronize your slow and fast autobuyers), or do it manually.</p>
    <p>Challenge 3: Easy. The only hard part of this is the very start, when you don't have any generators higher than Generator 1. However, due to the very small multiplier on Generator 1 (starting at ~r formatWithPrecision(1 / 256, 5) ~), this will be the case for a few minutes at the start, which you just have to mostly wait for. Buying Generator 1 a second time for ~i 4 ~ stars will let you get Generator 2 sooner, but buying it a third time for ~i 8 ~ stars won't, so buy it twice and not a third time. Once you get ~i 16 ~ stars and buy Generator 2 it should be fairly hard to even notice you're in a challenge. After you first prestige in Challenge 3, there'll be a short wait until you can get Generator 2 again, but this time it should be less than a minute. It's worth noting that overnight, you can do Challenge 3 at any point, since its increasing multiplier to Generator 1 will have the same effect as an additional ~i 2 ~x multiplier to all generators for every ~ts 2048 ~ (a bit more than ~ts 1800 ~) you wait. After ~ts 18000 ~ or so this is enough to easily get you to infinity.</p>
    <p>Challenge 4: Easy. This challenge doesn't have much special strategy, but you might want to wait to make a purchase of a higher generator (any generator other than Generator 1, but especially the highest few) until you can buy many at once (more explicitly, get about ~i 256 ~ times more stars than last time you bought things), since when you buy a higher generator you'll have to wait for all the ones below it to reach their previous levels again before you reach your prior star production.</p>
    <p>Challenge 5: Medium. This challenge starts out reasonable but gets harder due to you "missing" more purchases. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
    <p>Challenge 6: Hard. This challenge might seem not that bad at first, but it gets a lot harder later due to you missing ~i 2 ~ generator multipliers. It doesn't have any special strategy, though note that you can't sacrifice due to not getting Generator 8.</p>
    <p>Challenge 7: Hard. This challenge doesn't take too long (it's only a bit harder than Challenge 5 if you do it right) but it requires autobuyers to be off and has some strategy. Don't feel worried about doing prestiges; you can do prestiges even for ~i 2 ~x and you'll have a lot of purchases left over if you follow the advice here. For all prestiges but your last, buy only ~i 1 ~ of each generator (you can buy as many boosts as you want). For your last prestige (this is best to do when you have over ~i Math.pow(2, 208) ~ stars), turn the prestige autobuyer off (or otherwise make sure you don't prestige), buy as many Generator 8 as you can, then buy as many Generator 1 as you can. If you have leftover purchases, buy as many Generator 2 as you can. You should then wait until you can infinity.</p>
    <p>Challenge 8: Medium. This challenge is actually a bit faster than a normal infinity for most of the first prestige, but then gets slower at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
    <p>Challenge 9: Medium. This challenge is on the easy side of medium, and, like the other medium challenges, gets harder at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
    <p>Challenge 10: Hard. This challenge is almost like a different game. Buy ~i 1 ~ of each generator (it's all you can buy), then sacrifice. Repeat (it'll probably take ~i 64 ~ repetitions or so before you can infinity and finish the challenge, though it gets quicker with more infinity stars). Once you can sacrifice each time, only wait a few seconds to do so; waiting longer is basically a waste of time (and not waiting at all is fine).</p>
    <p>Challenge 11: Medium. As you'd probably expect, this challenge gets harder at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
    <p>Challenge 12: Consistent. This is like pre-infinity, but faster and with better automation. It doesn't have any special strategy; just do what you did first infinity. It might seem like this would be a good early challenge. However, actually infinity stars speed up a normal infinity quite a lot compared to Challenge 12, and so you can do several normal infinities in the time it'd take you to do Challenge 12. Furthermore, Challenge 12 is sped up somewhat by the multiplier to normal generators based on total infinity points. Thus, Challenge 12 is best to do either last or because you want to be able to do infinities automatically.</p>
    <p>In this paragraph, challenge orders within each sentence are suggestions and not following them probably won't make anything much harder. Do Challenge 1, Challenge 3, and Challenge 4 in ~i 3 ~ separate infinities. Then do ~i 5 ~ normal infinities (each of which is about ~ts 600 ~ long if you are active). Spend your ~i 16 ~ IP on an Infinity Generator 2. Then do Challenges 5, 8, 9, and 11. Spend ~i 8 ~ IP on the first infinity upgrade, increasing the multiplier per boost from ~i 2 ~x to ~f 2.25 ~x. Optionally do some more normal infinities now if you want. Do Challenges 2, 6, 7, 10, and 12, and then, having completed all challenges, break infinity in the Infinity tab.</p>
    <p>For autobuyers, you probably want to sacrifice for multiplier ~i 6 ~x, prestige for multiplier ~i 4 ~x, and, if you do Challenge 12 earlier than suggested here, infinity whenever possible, at least before breaking infinity (multiple settings lead to this).</p>
  </tab>
  <tab ~style.display=Tabs.currentTab() === 5 ? '' : 'none'~>
    <h3>Breaking infinity to starting Infinity Challenge 1</h3>
    <p>So, you've broken infinity. You can now get more infinity points from each infinity, if you get more stars. At the very start, you want to do slightly long infinities just to find out how many IP to infinity for so that you get the most IP/sec (infinity points per second), then do shorter infinities in each of which you get that many IP. (Of course, with this guide, finding out yourself how many IP to infinity for is mostly unnecessary.) Once IP/sec starts going down, it generally won't go back up in that infinity, except sometimes if you are about to be able to buy another boost (so that might be worth checking).</p>
    <p>Note that you cannot go beyond ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ stars in challenges even if infinity is broken, so don't try to, for example, spend months in Challenge 3 to get exponential infinity point gain. Also note that although you can now view the Infinity Challenges tab, it is not useful for a while.</p>
    <p>IP formula: stars^~r formatWithPrecision(1 / 256, 5) ~</p>
    <p>The order to buy things in is, most importantly, new infinity generators, second-most importantly, infinity upgrades (with the second being better than the first when they have the same cost), and least importantly, infinity generators you already have (these are so unimportant that even if they cost ~f 0.5 ~x the price of a new infinity generator or an infinity upgrade, you shouldn't buy them).</p>
    <p>Here are some example infinity point gain statistics (yours might be different due to having a different number of total IP or infinities). First get ~i 7 ~ IP per infinity with IP/sec going from roughly ~f 1 / 16 ~ (right after breaking infinity) to roughly ~f 1 / 8 ~. After buying the first infinity upgrade for ~i 64 ~ IP (increasing the per-boost multiplier to ~f 2.5 ~, which is a lot more useful than the first time now that you can get more boosts), get ~i 21 ~ IP per infinity with IP/sec going from roughly ~f 1 / 4 ~ to roughly ~f 11 / 16 ~.</p>
    <p>After buying Infinity Generator 3 (which, to repeat, you should do before buying the first infinity upgrade for ~i 512 ~ IP), you'll notice that IP/sec stops really going down at all (it might occasionally go down a little, but when you get your next boost it will mostly go back up). Do a single infinity for roughly ~ts 600 ~, getting ~i 512 ~ IP. Buy the first infinity upgrade again. Now (you can do this slightly later or earlier) start doing infinities for ~i 2 ~ IP until you have ~i 256 ~ infinities (to increase infinity generator multipliers). This should take about ~ti 7 ~ per infinity at first, decreasing to ~i 4 ~. After that, again do a single long infinity, this time for roughly ~ts 1200 ~ and for ~i 4096 ~ IP. The first two infinity upgrades should both have that cost; they're roughly equally good but the second is slightly better, so buy it. Now do another infinity for roughly ~ts 600 ~, but still for ~i 4096 ~ IP, and buy the first infinity upgrade.</p>
    <p>At this point you're on your own, because a long list of exact infinities seems like too much detail. Generally try to make sure that after every infinity, with the IP you got, you unlock an infinity upgrade, unlock a new infinity generator, or can make a lot (e.g., ~i 8 ~) infinity generator purchases. On the other hand, if you're getting more than ~i 16 ~x total IP per infinity at this point, your infinities are probably too long. You may want to get a bit more IP than the price of whatever you want to purchase, so that you can also buy some cheap infinity generators. Infinities will get longer at first, getting as long as ~ts 2700 ~ to ~ts 7200 ~ (how long your longest infinity is depends on how much more IP you try to infinity for each time), but past ~i Math.pow(2, 24) ~ IP infinities will get a bit shorter again, more specifically, ~ts 900 ~ to ~ts 1800 ~ long. The infinity autobuyer isn't that useful in this part, but if you know how much IP you want to infinity for, then you can set it to that.</p>
    <p>At ~f Decimal.pow(2, 8192) ~ stars, which you can reach in about ~ts 21600 ~ from ~i 4096 ~ IP, Infinity Challenge 1 should become unlocked and thus possible to start. Don't start it until you get the first infinity upgrade costing ~i Math.pow(2, 33) ~ IP and the second infinity upgrade costing ~i Math.pow(2, 32) ~ IP. Note that after buying the second infinity upgrade for ~i Math.pow(2, 32) ~ IP, it will be maxed and you will not be able to buy it again its effect should now be that generators are multiplied by (infinity stars)^~f 1.5 ~, rather than the original (infinity stars)^~f 0.5 ~. Anyway, you can now start Infinity Challenge 1, so do that. The next section of the guide becomes visible when you complete Infinity Challenge 1, so information on how to do so is in this section (it is also repeated in the next section).</p>
    <p>Infinity challenges (or ICs) are much like challenges, except they require more stars to infinity than a normal infinity (you cannot go beyond their star requirement in them whether or not infinity is broken), and after completing them you get some new bonus to something rather than getting an autobuyer and get a multiplier to infinity generators of ~i 2 ~^(completed infinity challenges / ~i 4 ~) rather than a multiplier to normal generators. Infinity challenges can generally be grouped into the easy ones with no special strategy and the hard ones with special strategy. Unlike previous challenges, they unlock in a particular order, which is also the order you should complete them in.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 1: Hard. This is a bunch of challenges combined (Challenges 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), and its strategy is mostly taken from Challenge 7, so follow the strategy given above for that challenge. The differences are that you want to spend at least ~ts 300 ~ before prestiging (to build up infinity stars and thus do fewer prestiges, letting you save more purchases for the last prestige), you want to spend at least ~ts 60 ~ in each prestige (again, to do fewer prestiges), your last prestige should instead be when you reach over ~i Decimal.pow(2, 976) ~ stars (because of the goal of ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1024) ~ being far higher than the goal for Challenge 3), and that at the end you should buy Generator 6 rather than Generator 8, because Generator 8 does not exist due to Challenge 6. Despite Challenge 2 making boosts reset multipliers, boosts are worth buying as soon as you can afford them. You don't have to worry about sacrifice because, due to Challenge 6, you can't do it. Infinity Challenge 1 should take ~ts 1200 ~ to ~ts 1800 ~. It's perhaps worth noting that you can complete this challenge eventually just by buying a Generator 1 and waiting, since it includes Challenge 3, but this will take a day at least.</p>

    <h3>Starting Infinity Challenge 1 to eternity</h3>
    <p>Infinity challenges (or ICs) are much like challenges, except they require more stars to infinity than a normal infinity (you cannot go beyond their star requirement in them whether or not infinity is broken), and after completing them you get some new bonus to something rather than getting an autobuyer and get a multiplier to infinity generators of ~i 2 ~^(completed infinity challenges / ~i 4 ~) rather than a multiplier to normal generators. Infinity challenges can generally be grouped into the easy ones with no special strategy and the hard ones with special strategy. Unlike previous challenges, they unlock in a particular order, which is also the order you should complete them in.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 1: Hard. This is a bunch of challenges combined (Challenges 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), and its strategy is mostly taken from Challenge 7, so follow the strategy given above for that challenge. The differences are that you want to spend at least ~ts 300 ~ before prestiging (to build up infinity stars and thus do fewer prestiges, letting you save more purchases for the last prestige), you want to spend at least ~ts 60 ~ in each prestige (again, to do fewer prestiges), your last prestige should instead be when you reach over ~i Decimal.pow(2, 976) ~ stars (because of the goal of ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1024) ~ being far higher than the goal for Challenge 3), and that at the end you should buy Generator 6 rather than Generator 8, because Generator 8 does not exist due to Challenge 6. Despite Challenge 2 making boosts reset multipliers, boosts are worth buying as soon as you can afford them. You don't have to worry about sacrifice because, due to Challenge 6, you can't do it. Infinity Challenge 1 should take ~ts 1200 ~ to ~ts 1800 ~. It's perhaps worth noting that you can complete this challenge eventually just by buying a Generator 1 and waiting, since it includes Challenge 3, but this will take a day at least.</p>
    <p>The Infinity Challenge 1 reward uncaps the multiplier to normal generators based on total IP, which, at this point, gives normal generators at least an additional ~i Math.pow(2, 28) ~x multiplier. This means that your next few infinities will be very quick; for example, you can now get enough IP to buy Infinity Generator 6 for the first time (~i Math.pow(2, 36) ~ IP) in a infinity that is ~ts 180 ~ long (which is a reasonable thing to do strategically if you want). Infinities are now so short that they are a bit limited by autobuyers. In this part of the game, try to infinity for roughly ~i 16 ~x total IP each time (though it's OK to infinity earlier if that would let you get a new infinity generator that you don't have yet). You can do roughly this (definitely close enough) with the infinity autobuyer by setting its mode to "X times best of last ten" and its input to ~i 16 ~, though you'll still have to buy infinity upgrades (well, the one of them that isn't yet maxed) and infinity generators. Infinities will get slightly longer over time, going roughly from ~ts 180 ~ to ~ts 900 ~, until you unlock Infinity Challenge 2. When you unlock Infinity Challenge 2, infinity and then start it.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 2: Easy. Sacrifice formula is stars^~f 1 / 8 ~, but since prestige is square-rooted there's a fairly big overall nerf. The challenge still doesn't require any special strategy, though. However, it does take about ~ts 1200 ~.</p>
    <p>The Infinity Challenge 2 reward increases the sacrifice formula to stars^~f 1 / 64 ~, if it's bigger than the old formula (which it usually is). This is equivalent to almost a ~i Math.pow(2, 40) ~x multiplier to each normal generator. This will, as before, make your next few infinities far quicker. Also, due to your extra infinity generators making infinity stars increase faster and thus making longer infinities better, start to infinity for ~i 64 ~x IP rather than ~i 16 ~x. The length of infinities will increase from ~ts 180 ~ (right after IC2 completion) to ~ts 1200 ~, until you unlock Infinity Challenge 3. Infinity Challenge 3 is somewhat hard, so it might be worth getting somewhat more IP before starting it, even after you unlock it.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 3: Hard. Be very careful about when you prestige; turn the prestige autobuyer off (though you can leave all others on). Prestige for at least ~i Math.pow(2, 322) ~, ~i Math.pow(2, 542) ~, ~i Math.pow(2, 641) ~ and ~i Math.pow(2, 644) ~ prestige power in your first ~i 4 ~ prestiges, in that order; after that, you won't be able to prestige again. It can take up to ~ts 1800 ~ (mostly spent in the first prestige), but it's shorter if you got more IP before starting it.</p>
    <p>Compared to previous IC rewards, the IC3 reward is rather weak. Infinities will still be about ~ts 600 ~ to ~ts 900 ~ long until you unlock IC4 (which should only take a few more infinities).</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 4: Hard. This infinity challenge is best done with your autobuyers set to trigger only every ~ti 17 ~, and with your prestige autobuyer set in such a way that you gain a significant multiplier each time (setting its mode to time and its input to ~i 136 ~ is good); it then takes about ~ts 1800 ~. You can slightly speed it up by manually prestiging somewhat earlier for the first few prestiges, or by manually buying things quicker at the start of each prestige, which makes it somewhat shorter.</p>
    <p>Since the IC4 reward is roughly linear with time in infinity (~i 1 ~ + seconds in infinity / ~i 64 ~), it rewards longer infinities. Thus, it is now best to infinity for ~i 4096 ~ times best of last ten rather than ~i 64 ~ times. Infinities will still be ~ts 600 ~ to ~ts 1500 ~ long (though remember that you're making about twice as much progress per infinity) until you unlock IC5.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 5: Easy. This infinity challenge doesn't have any special strategy. The infinity challenge condition means in practice that every prestige starts with a few useless seconds, so you might think that setting your prestige autobuyer to ~ti 10 ~ or something like that is good because it will stop you from doing a lot of useless short prestiges, but in reality you can leave it at ~i 4 ~x and the challenge will take about as long because you still have to wait for infinity stars to build up. This is a rather fast infinity challenge, taking only about ~ts 600 ~.</p>
    <p>The IC5 reward is, initially, slightly worse than the IC3 reward, so it doesn't really change much. Continue to infinity for ~i 4096 ~x. Infinities will still be ~ts 1500 ~ to ~ts 2400 ~ long until you unlock IC6, in ~i 1 ~ or ~i 2 ~ more infinities.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 6: Hard. This infinity challenge requires you to turn all your autobuyers off. When the next prestige formula is normal (^~i 1 ~), get just enough stars to prestige. Generally buying ~i 1 ~ of each generator until you're close to the prestige requirement (this will probably usually have you buying ~i 1 ~ of the first ~i 7 ~ generators, but not the eighth), then buying a few boosts (but not maxing boosts) will do this. When the next prestige formula is weaker (^~f 0.5 ~), buy max repeatedly and sacrifice until stars stop going up that much, then prestige. Once you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.75 * Math.pow(2, 13)) ~ stars with the next prestige formula being weaker, your strategy should change. Specifically, you should prestige, do a prestige where the next prestige formula is normal but you buy max and sacrifice as if it were weaker and you prestige at ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.75 * Math.pow(2, 13)) ~ stars again (but with the stronger prestige formula), then turn all autobuyers on. At this point you won't be able to prestige again, but you should be able to finish the infinity challenge. This challenge takes ~ts 600 ~, but some of that is spent doing things manually.</p>
    <p>The IC6 reward is actually decently strong, somewhat stronger than the IC1 or IC2 rewards were on completion. It won't speed up infinities as much, though, because of the IC4 reward still making long infinities better. Still, infinities should only be about ~ts 600 ~ to ~ts 900 ~ long until you unlock IC7, in ~i 1 ~ or ~i 2 ~ more infinities.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 7: Easy. Prestige power is far more important than boosts, which is why this challenge is a nerf. This challenge doesn't require any special strategy, and takes about ~ts 300 ~.</p>
    <p>The IC7 reward is fairly small; it's slightly larger than the IC5 reward was, but not much larger (it's about a ~i Math.pow(2, 15) ~x multiplier to normal generators). It's interesting to note that it actually gets smaller as you progress, not just in comparison to your stars but overall. Still, infinities should only be about ~ts 600 ~ long until you unlock IC8, in ~i 1 ~ or ~i 2 ~ more infinities.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 8: Hard. This infinity challenge doesn't take too long but has strategy. First, turn all your autobuyers off, then manually buy ~i 1 ~ each of Generator 1 through Generator 7, then buy max of Generator 8. Then, without turning autobuyers on yet, set autobuyers to buy singles of Generators 1 through Generator 7 and boosts, buy max of Generator 8, sacrifice for some huge unreachable multiplier (like ~i Decimal.pow(2, 4096) ~), and prestige for ~i 1 ~x multiplier. Then turn autobuyers on. Once you have ~i Math.pow(2, 22) ~ IC8 purchases, set your non-prestige autobuyers as if you were playing normally, and set your prestige autobuyer to ~i Math.pow(2, 22) ~x. You should now be able to complete the challenge without using all your purchases, and without changing the prestige autobuyer. This challenge takes about ~ts 300 ~. Remember to change your prestige autobuyer back to ~i 4 ~x after finishing the challenge. It's not clear if doing this challenge is actually worthwhile, given how close eternity is.</p>
    <p>The IC8 reward is about as strong as the IC7 reward. Infinities should only be about ~ts 300 ~ to ~ts 600 ~ long until you can eternity, in ~i 1 ~ or ~i 2 ~ more infinities.</p>
    <p>Unlike stars when you could infinity, IP don't cap at ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~. However, getting enough more to get more than ~i 2 ~ eternity points isn't worth it yet, so eternity for ~i 2 ~ eternity points as soon as you can. You can get to this point from the start of infinity challenges in about ~ts 32400 ~.</p>

    <h3>Eternity to completing all eternity milestones</h3>
    <p>So, you've eternitied. This resets basically everything. You keep your slow autobuyers, and that's basically it. However, with your ~i 2 ~ eternity points (EP) you can, and should, buy an Eternity Generator 1. Eternity generators (EGs) are like normal generators and infinity generators except that they cost eternity points. Eternity stars have two effects: a multiplier and a power. Note that you start with ~i 2 ~ eternity stars at the start of each eternity. Eternity stars and eternity generators reset on eternity to the same extent infinity stars and infinity generators reset on infinity.</p>
    <p>Multiplier from eternity stars: (eternity stars)x.</p>
    <p>Power from eternity stars: ~i 1 ~ + log(log(eternity stars, 2), 2) / ~i 512 ~</p>
    <p>You won't want to get more than ~i 2 ~ EP per eternity for a while, but just for reference, here's the EP formula.</p>
    <p>EP formula: (total IP this eternity)^~r formatWithPrecision(1 / 256, 5) ~</p>
    <p>The starting benefits from milestones are below, in the hopes that they will be convenient.</p>
    <p>Milestone formulas: ~i 4 ~^(min(~i 64 ~, eternities)) starting stars, ~i 2 ~^(min(~i 128 ~, eternities / ~i 2 ~)) starting IP, min(~i 16 ~, eternities)^~i 2 ~ starting infinities</p>
    <p>The second eternity is much like the first, except far quicker, and generally following the guide above works. Following are the important differences, together with other important things to note.</p>
    <p>You should do your first infinity in Challenge 12, because the condition does nothing and you'll get an autobuyer and a small multiplier for it. You don't need to unlock slow autobuyers again, since they're already unlocked. Challenge 1 is comparatively harder, because the multiplier from eternity stars only applies to ~i 1 ~ generator (albeit ^~i 4 ~); you may thus want to do Challenge 1 as a medium-difficulty challenge rather than an easy challenge, and do an extra normal infinity instead so you still have Infinity Generator 2 before starting the medium-difficulty challenges. Challenge 2 is a tiny bit more annoying due to not being quicker by as much as the rest of the game is; you may want to do it last, and to do more normal infinities before doing it, but you will be able to buy things more often (every ~ti 2 ~ is fine). ~i 30 ~ total infinities is enough to max the multiplier to normal generators from total IP, which helps for that. Right after breaking infinity, the best IP per infinity is somewhat higher; for example, ~i 96 ~ IP on your first infinity after breaking infinity is reasonable. Don't forget to get ~i 256 ~ infinities; this isn't a difference, but it's one of the easier things to forget because not doing it slows down progress rather than stopping it (these infinities will probably be far quicker than before, though, which is a difference). Infinity Challenge 1 doesn't require as much waiting before prestiging; ~ts 60 ~ should be more than enough. More generally, almost every infinity challenge is far quicker. For the sake of speed, it may be best to infinity and start an infinity challenge immediately after unlocking it rather than waiting for your infinity autobuyer's requirement.</p>
    <p>After Infinity Challenge 1, due to how quick infinities are, it's better to set prestige to ~ti 3 ~ than to ~i 4 ~x. However, note that whenever you set the prestige autobuyer or another reset autobuyer (such as the infinity autobuyer) based on time, if you go offline, ticks will be longer and so the autobuyer may trigger every few ticks, which may not let production build up enough. So if you go offline, you may want to adjust your reset autobuyers to trigger less often or instead be based on multiplier.</p>
    <p>Due to eternity stars, setting your infinity autobuyer to ~i 4096 ~x best of last ten is good even just after Infinity Challenge 1, for the rest of the eternity. If you want, you can do slightly better manually early on by doing slightly longer infinities, because of how powerful Infinity Challenge 1 is (also note what was said above about starting an infinity challenge immediately after unlock). Infinity Challenge 4 is not far quicker; it's not worth doing and should be skipped. Because you start with ~i 4 ~ stars, Infinity Challenge 5 doesn't have as much of a delay at the start of every prestige, so you can leave the prestige autobuyer at ~ti 3 ~ and it'll be fine. Infinity Challenge 8 is not far quicker because its speed depends on autobuyer speed, and definitely should be skipped. Make sure to buy a theorem (in the Studies tab) for ~i Decimal.pow(2, Math.pow(2, 16)) ~ stars and to buy another for ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ IP; it's not crucial that you do this now, but you'll have to do it in one of the next ~i 3 ~ eternities (counting this one) and there's no reason not to do it now. Generally, from now on, you should buy theorems with stars and IP as soon as they become affordable, even if this isn't stated explicitly.</p>
    <p>Overall, your second eternity can be as short as ~ts 7200 ~ to ~ts 9000 ~.</p>
    <p>It is best to spend your next ~i 6 ~ EP (including the ~i 2 ~ you just got) on ~i 2 ~ theorems, for ~i 2 ~ EP and ~i 4 ~ EP (it doesn't really matter whether you buy both theorems at once, or buy the first earlier and the second later). This will give you ~i 4 ~ total theorems, which will let you buy Study 3, which will speed up eternities a lot. So don't buy Eternity Generator 1 again until you have ~i 4 ~ total theorems.</p>
    <p>Your third eternity is a lot like the second, except that, from the ~i 2 ~-eternity eternity milestone, you start with all challenges (but not infinity challenges) completed, with all fast autobuyers, and with infinity broken, and since eternity generators are all multiplied by min(~i 1 ~, eternities / ~i 256 ~), eternity stars will produce ~i 2 ~x as fast. The strategy is similar to that for second eternity, except that you don't need to do challenges, and there's thus no reason to do your first infinity in Challenge 12. Remember to set your prestige autobuyer back to ~i 4 ~x until you complete IC1. You still want to do some early infinities for ~i 2 ~ IP, perhaps until ~i 30 ~ infinities and ~i 60 ~ total IP. Once you're done with those early infinities, you can (though this is not strictly necessary) infinity a few times for ~i 16 ~ to ~i 32 ~ IP per infinity, then do more quick infinities to get up to ~i 256 ~ infinities (infinity length will get down to roughly ~ti 1 ~ by the end of this). Infinity Challenge 5 now has basically no delay at the start of each prestige.</p>
    <p>Overall, your third eternity can be as short as ~ts 3600 ~ to ~ts 4500 ~.</p>
    <p>Your fourth eternity is almost the same as the third, except that, from the ~i 3 ~-eternity eternity milestone, you can buy an Infinity Generator 1 before you infinity. Again, remember to set your prestige autobuyer back to ~i 4 ~x until you complete IC1. This eternity will be about the same length as the previous one.</p>
    <p>Now you can finally buy another theorem for ~i 4 ~ EP and buy Study 3. This will make eternities a lot quicker. Getting ~i 256 ~ infinities is now unnecessary. The ~i 4 ~-eternity eternity milestone lets you set the sacrifice autobuyer to ~i 1 ~x. You can prestige and infinity manually (prestiges should be roughly ~ti 1 ~ long and infinities should be roughly ~ti 30 ~ long), or you can set your prestige autobuyer to ~ti 1 ~ and your infinity autobuyer to ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x best of last ten. You should still eternity for ~i 2 ~ EP. This eternity should take about ~ts 600 ~ (maybe slightly quicker), mostly limited by autobuyers and (if you prestige and infinity manually) manual speed.</p>
    <p>Now keep doing eternities much like the last. The ~i 5 ~-eternity eternity milestone gives you some infinities (initally ~i 25 ~), which helps a bit but not that much. When you have ~i 6 ~ eternities, you can (and should) get another EG1. The ~i 6 ~-eternity eternity milestone automatically completes ICs, which means you don't need to do them yourself and is thus very helpful. At this point, eternities are about ~ts 180 ~ long and you can just stay on the infinity tab. The ~i 7 ~-eternity eternity milestone is just autobuyers (on by default) and thus is not much of a speedup. The ~i 8 ~-eternity eternity milestone lets you set the prestige autobuyer to prestige for a ~i 1 ~x multiplier, which is a very big speedup. You can also set the infinity autobuyer to infinity every ~ti 5 ~. You'll still need to buy infinity generators until you get autobuyers for them, though. Eternities should now be about ~ts 60 ~ to ~ts 90 ~ long. When you have ~i 14 ~ eternities, you can, and should, buy EG2. After about ~ts 600 ~ to ~ts 900 ~ from ~i 8 ~ eternity, you'll have ~i 16 ~ eternities and thus will have completed all eternity milestones.</p>

    <h3>Completing all eternity milestones to unlocking the Eternity Producer</h3>
    <p>In this section of the game, you'll start to have several studies at once and to need to determine which studies are best. Generally, a multiplier to infinity generators is ~i 15 ~ times better than the same multiplier to normal generators, and a multiplier to eternity generators is slightly better than (however many eternity generators you have any of) times better than the same multiplier to infinity generators. Of course, the studies that multiply normal generators generally have the biggest multipliers, and those that multiply eternity generators generally have the smallest multipliers, so determining which is best requires some mental arithemetic (and of course, multipliers should be compared logarithmically; a ~i 256 ~x multiplier is only ~i 2 ~x as good as a ~i 16 ~x multiplier to the same thing, since ~i 256 ~ is ~i 16 ~^~i 2 ~).</p>
    <p>First, turn off your eternity autobuyer. It's good in general, but there are advantages to doing a somewhat long eternity now. It gives less EP/second, but it makes Study 3 stronger and lets you get more theorems. Getting to ~i Math.pow(2, 512) ~ IP should be enough to get another theorem with stars, get another theorem with IP, and noticeably increase Study 3's multiplier without taking too long (~ts 240 ~ to ~ts 300 ~), so do that. Note that you should buy the theorems with stars and IP as soon as you can afford them, as stated above. Then start doing quick eternities for ~i 2 ~ EP again. In addition to this being efficient for IP/second, it makes EGs slightly stronger via more eternities, and gives you more starting benefits (in particular starting IP), which makes eternities even quicker.</p>
    <p>As for what to spend your EP on, first buy the first eternity upgrade once, then start saving for theorems with EP. After buying a theorem for ~i 8 ~ EP and another theorem for ~i 16 ~ EP, you can buy Study 4 to speed up quick eternities even more.</p>
    <p>At some point soon (you could do this immediately, or make it slightly faster by getting more eternities first), you should try to do another longer eternity to get more theorems. For this longer eternity, you'll want Studies 1 and 3, rather than 3 and 4, so respec your studies and buy Studies 1 and 3. You should be able to get ~i 2 ~ more theorems with stars and also another theorem with infinity points, for ~i 11 ~ total theorems, fairly quickly. After about ~ts 300 ~ (right before the second theorem bought with stars) you should switch the infinity autobuyer to ~ti 10 ~ since IP gain will start to slow down. Overall this eternity should take about ~ts 420 ~. Remember to set your eternity autobuyer back to ~i 2 ~ EP, and also you'll want to respec and buy Studies 3 and 4. Additionally, you can now set the infinity autobuyer to ~ti 2 ~. Furthermore, soon you'll be able to buy another theorem for ~i 50 ~ EP. Do so, and buy Study 1 (in addition to Studies 3 and 4, which you already have).</p>
    <p>Eternities are useful enough that you should try to get ~i 256 ~ of them right now. They should only take roughly ~ti 4 ~ each. Buy EG2 again, then buy EG1 as it becomes affordable. From now on, advice about buying eternity upgrades and generators is similar to that about buying infinity upgrades and generators. The third and second upgrades start out good (the third especially so) but get worse per purchase; the first starts out bad but gets better per purchase (though it can only be purchased ~i 7 ~ times, at which point its effect is ^~i 8 ~, making the per-purchase eternity generator multiplier ~i 2 ~x).</p>
    <p>Eternities will start to be ~ti 2 ~ long once you have roughly ~i 160 ~ of them. This makes it even easier to get to ~i 256 ~ eternities.</p>
    <p>Once you have ~i 256 ~ eternities, keep doing quick ~i 2 ~-EP eternities, and save EP to buy another theorem for ~i 256 ~ EP. Once you can buy that theorem, buy it (giving you ~i 12 ~ total theorems), and do another longer eternity with Studies 1, 2, and 3, and with your infinity autobuyer set to ~ti 5 ~. As before, switch the infinity autobuyer to ~ti 10 ~ after ~ts 300 ~. You should be able to, within about ~ts 540 ~ from the start of the eternity, buy another theorem with stars and ~i 2 ~ more theorems with IP, for a total of ~i 16 ~ theorems. You can now buy Study 4, so do that. Stay in this eternity until you can buy another theorem with stars, for a total of ~i 17 ~ theorems.</p>
    <p>Now you can do slightly longer eternities for maximum EP/second. Set your infinity autobuyer to ~ti 2 ~ and your eternity autobuyer to ~i 16 ~ EP. You should get about ~f 1.375 ~ EP/second by doing this. Save EP for EG3 (~i 512 ~ EP), after buying which you should get ~f 1.5 ~ EP/minute, then for the first eternity upgrade for the second time (~i 256 ~ EP). Then buy all eternity generators costing up to ~i 512 ~ EP in any order you want. By the end of this, you'll be getting about ~f 1.75 ~ EP/second.</p>
    <p>Now save up for the second eternity upgrade. After buying it, do a longer eternity. Set your infinity autobuyer to ~ti 10 ~ and turn off your eternity autobuyer.</p>
    <p>After about ~ts 60 ~, you will get more than ~i 320 ~ boosts and thus start producing boost power. Each boost reached in the current eternity above ~i 320 ~ boosts (that is, max(0, boosts reached this eternity - ~i 320 ~) boosts)) produces ~r formatWithPrecision(Math.pow(2, -14), 5) ~ boost power per second, so boost power gain is max(0, boosts reached this eternity - ~i 320 ~) * ~r formatWithPrecision(Math.pow(2, -14), 5) ~) per second. Losing boosts due to prestige or infinity does not decrease boost power production. Boost power resets on eternity (as does boost power production), but not on infinity. Boost power provides a multiplier to boosts based on its amount (~i 1 ~ + log(amount, ~i 2 ~)). You also get theorems (which you keep on eternity) at certain thresholds of boost power. Boost power makes long eternities decent (but still not yet as good as short eternities for EP/second) and is eventually a major reason that they become better.</p>
    <p>~ts 1200 ~ after the start of the eternity, you should be able to buy another theorem with stars and ~i 2 ~ more theorems with IP, and should also have gotten ~i 2 ~ extra theorems from boost power for a total of ~i 22 ~ theorems. Progress is slowing down, but you should continue this eternity anyway, so set the infinity autobuyer to ~ti 20 ~ instead of ~i 10 ~.</p>
    <p>~ts 900 ~ later (~ts 2100 ~ after the start of the eternity), you should be able to buy another theorem with ~f Decimal.pow(2, Math.pow(2, 19.5)) ~ stars and should also have gotten ~i 1 ~ more extra theorem from boost power (if you have less than ~i 8 ~ boost power, wait until you have ~i 8 ~), for ~i 24 ~ total theorems. Now you should eternity, buy a theorem with EP for ~i 25 ~ total theorems, and buy Studies 2, 3, 4, and 8.</p>
    <p>Do eternities for ~i 2 ~ EP (and infinities for ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ IP with the mode being amount) until you have ~i 2048 ~ eternities, to make Study 7 slightly stronger. Each eternity should be about ~t 0.5 ~ long. After that, change the infinity autobuyer to ~ti 10 ~, turn the eternity autobuyer off, and buy Studies 5, 6, 7, and 8. You'll be doing another longer eternity, since longer eternities are now the best way to get more EP/second. However, you should now have almost enough EP to buy the first eternity upgrade again for ~i 4096 ~ EP, so, before doing your longer eternity, eternity as soon as doing so will give you enough EP to buy that upgrade, and then buy it (it should only take ~ts 120 ~ to ~ts 180 ~).</p>
    <p>~ts 1200 ~ after the start of the eternity, you should be able to buy another theorem with IP and should set your infinity autobuyer to ~ti 20 ~. ~ts 600 ~ later (~ts 1800 ~ after the start of the eternity), you should be able to buy another theorem with stars and should've gotten (or be about to get) another theorem from boost power (bringing you up to ~i 28 ~ total theorems). Don't eternity yet, though. ~ts 600 ~ later (~ts 2400 ~ after the start of the eternity), you should be able to eternity for ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~ EP. Do that, and buy the third eternity upgrade (which is at this point even better than EG4). If you have a small amount of extra EP, buy cheap eternity generators. Also, instead of Studies 5, 6, 7, and 8, buy Studies 3, 5, 6, and 8, which you can now do with your additional theorems.</p>
    <p>Do another longer eternity, with the infinity autobuyer set to ~ti 10 ~. After about ~ts 900 ~, you should be able to again eternity for ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~ EP. Do that, and buy EG4. Do another eternity for ~i Math.pow(2, 17) ~ EP (which should take about ~ts 600 ~), and buy the first eternity upgrade and another theorem for ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~ EP.</p>
    <p>In your next eternity, you should get ~i Math.pow(2, 20) ~ EP, which will take ~ts 1800 ~ to ~ts 2100 ~. During this eternity, you'll get another theorem with IP, for a total of ~i 30 ~ theorems. Spend the EP you get on unlocking the Eternity Producer. You can reach this point about ~ts 16200 ~ after getting all eternity milestones.</p>
  </tab>
  <tab ~style.display=Tabs.currentTab() === 9 ? '' : 'none'~>
    <h3>Unlocking the Eternity Producer to starting Eternity Challenge 1</h3>
    <p>The Eternity Producer produces eternities, and gives a multiplier to eternity generators based on their amount. Upgrades for it (to produce more eternities and increase the multiplier) are generally fairly minor: worse than an eternity upgrade with the same cost, but better than an eternity generator. Note that with more eternities (from, for example, waiting overnight), progress will be significantly faster and the time it takes to do things after getting a large number of additional eternities will likely be less than the time given below.</p>
    <p>Do another long eternity (about ~ts 3600 ~) to get another theorem with stars and another extra theorem from boost power, increasing your total theorems to ~i 32 ~. Since this eternity is long, setting your infinity autobuyer to ~ti 20 ~ is slightly helpful. Now do an eternity (about ~ts 1500 ~ long) for ~i Math.pow(2, 24) ~ EP (with infinity autobuyer back at ~ti 10 ~) with Studies 5, 6, 8, and 10. Buy the second eternity upgrade (rather than the first). At this point, you should replace Study 10 with Study 9 instead. Do another eternity for ~i Math.pow(2, 24) ~ EP, which should take about ~ts 720 ~, and buy the first eternity upgrade. Do another eternity for ~i Math.pow(2, 25) ~ EP, which should take about ~ts 900 ~, and buy EG5.</p>
    <p>From now on, you can choose when to do eternities yourself. Generally try to get between ~i 2 ~x and ~i 16 ~x your total EP in each eternity, with smaller multipliers like ~i 2 ~x generally being better early and larger multipliers like ~i 16 ~x generally being better late. If you're about to be able to get a theorem, wait for it. Generally, almost all eternities should be less than ~ts 3600 ~.</p>
    <p>Once you have ~i 36 ~ theorems and EG6, you should buy Study 10 instead of Study 8. The Study 10 multiplier raised ^~i 6 ~ is a bit weaker than the Study 8 multiplier, but due to the various things eternity stars do, Study 10 is still slightly better. Roughly when you buy a theorem for ~f Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, 5.5)) ~ EP, Study 8 becomes slightly better than Study 10 again (and remains better for a while), so you should replace Study 10 by Study 8 again. While trying to get ~i Math.pow(2, 48) ~ EP (or, slightly earlier, ~f Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, 5.5)) ~ EP), there's a small wall and so you'll probably need to do a long eternity (~ts 7200 ~); if you set the infinity autobuyer to ~ti 20 ~ during this eternity (not after it), you should be able to get a theorem for ~i 256 ~ boost power, perhaps by making the eternity somewhat longer (~ts 9000 ~). Getting this theorem (and the theorem for ~f Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, 5.5)) ~ EP) will let you buy Study 7, in addition to 5, 6, 8, and 9. After about ~i Math.pow(2, 48) ~ EP, eternities should become a lot faster than they were immediately before (they should now be ~ts 600 ~ to ~ts 1800 ~ long), and you should be able to get as far as buying the second eternity upgrade for ~i Math.pow(2, 60) ~ EP in about ~ts 3600 ~. Once you buy the second eternity upgrade for ~i Math.pow(2, 60) ~ EP, you should do an eternity with Studies 5, 6, 8, and 9 and unlock Eternity Challenge 1 when possible. After unlocking Eternity Challenge 1, start it. You can reach this point in about ~ts 43200 ~ from unlocking the Eternity Producer.</p>
    <p> The next section of the guide becomes visible when you complete Eternity Challenge 1 for the first time, so information on how to do so is in this section (it is also repeated in the next section).</p>
    <p>Eternity challenges (or ECs) are somewhat like challenges and infinity challenges. There are several important differences, however. Eternity challenges require a certain amount of IP to eternity and complete the challenge, rather than a certain amount of stars to infinity and complete the challenge. They have infinity-challenge-like rewards that make various things stronger, but they can each be completed up to ~i 4 ~ times, having a higher goal amount of IP each time and getting a stronger reward for each time completed. Finally, they have a requirement (depending on times completed) and a cost in theorems (fixed for each challenge) to unlock, and must be explicitly unlocked to be entered. Note that you can respec studies in an eternity challenge if you want. You will get the theorems you paid to unlock an eternity challenge back when you complete it or respec your eternity challenge (which will lock it again).</p>
    <p>To recap, you can do EC1 the first time (EC1x1) at ~i Math.pow(2, 60) ~ EP, unlocking it with Studies 5, 6, 8, and 9. Once you unlock it, respec your studies and buy Studies 3, 8, 10, and 12. Within EC1x1, you should infinity for ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x best of last ten rather than, for example, every ~ti 10 ~. This challenge should take about ~ts 360 ~ to ~ts 420 ~ to complete.</p>

    <h3>Starting Eternity Challenge 1 to unlocking chroma</h3>
    <p>Eternity challenges (or ECs) are somewhat like challenges and infinity challenges. There are several important differences, however. Eternity challenges require a certain amount of IP to eternity and complete the challenge, rather than a certain amount of stars to infinity and complete the challenge. They have infinity-challenge-like rewards that make various things stronger, but they can each be completed up to ~i 4 ~ times, having a higher goal amount of IP each time and getting a stronger reward for each time completed. Finally, they have a requirement (depending on times completed) and a cost in theorems (fixed for each challenge) to unlock, and must be explicitly unlocked to be entered. Note that you can respec studies in an eternity challenge if you want. You will get the theorems you paid to unlock an eternity challenge back when you complete it or respec your eternity challenge (which will lock it again).</p>
    <p>To recap, you can do EC1 the first time (EC1x1) at ~i Math.pow(2, 60) ~ EP, unlocking it with Studies 5, 6, 8, and 9. Once you unlock it, respec your studies and buy Studies 3, 8, 10, and 12. Within EC1x1, you should infinity for ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x best of last ten rather than, for example, every ~ti 10 ~. This challenge should take about ~ts 360 ~ to ~ts 420 ~ to complete.</p>
    <p>Switch back to infinities that are ~ti 10 ~ long and Studies 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 after completing EC1x1. You should be able to get ~i Math.pow(2, 64) ~ EP and buy EG8 with it in an eternity between ~ts 900 ~ and ~ts 1200 ~ long. EG8 will make eternities somewhat faster (~ts 600 ~). When (slightly later) you get ~i 46 ~ total theorems, replace Study 7 by Study 10, making your studies be 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. Once you get roughly ~i Math.pow(2, 72) ~ EP, you can do EC2x1 (EC2 for the first time). Unlock it with Studies 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and complete it with Studies 6, 8, 9, and 10. Unlocking and completing it should each take less than ~ts 180 ~. After completing EC2x1, switch back to Studies 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. At this point, your eternities should generally be for between ~i 4 ~x and ~i 16 ~x total EP. Getting ~i Math.pow(2, 89) ~ EP is somewhat hard (it requires an eternity that is ~ts 1800 ~ long), but once you get that much EP you can do EC1x2 (EC1 for the second time). Unlock with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (which should take roughly ~ts 300 ~), and complete with 8, 10, 11, and 12 (if you already have ~i Math.pow(2, 20) ~ eternities, you can use 8, 9, 10, and 12 instead and thus not have to wait for 11 to build up). As before, infinity for ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x best of last ten within EC1x2. EC1x2 will take about ~ts 3600 ~ to complete.</p>
    <p>Next, for maximum speed, you should actually do EC4x1. EC3x1 has a slightly lower unlock requirement and cost than EC4x1, but is significantly harder (though both have similar requirements for completion). I do regret that EC4x1 comes before EC3x1, though in general completion x of EC4 is harder than completion x of EC3. For EC4x1, you should get ~i Math.pow(2, 97) ~ total EP (via a eternity roughly ~ts 2400 ~ long), and unlock and complete with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. When doing EC4x1, wait ~ts 180 ~ before your first infinity to let boost power and eternity stars build up, and then do eternities that are ~ti 20 ~ long. You should easily be able to complete EC4x1 in roughly ~ts 420 ~. Then do EC3x1. Unlock with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and complete with 3, 8, 9, 12. Infinity for ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x best of last ten within EC3x1. EC3x1 should take at most roughly ~ts 900 ~, though it is faster if you have more eternities; it will take only ~ts 60 ~ to ~ts 120 ~ if you have ~i Math.pow(2, 20) ~ eternities.</p>
    <p>After doing EC3x1 and EC4x1 (whatever order you do them in), you'll have a burst of progress; it's now better to do eternities for ~i 8 ~x to ~i 64 ~x in general, though your first eternity after EC3x1 and EC4x1 might give you even more EP than that (your eternities should be at least ~ts 300 ~ long). At about ~i Math.pow(2, 114) ~ total EP (by which point progress should still be rather fast, with eternities lasting less than ~ts 600 ~) do EC1x3, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, complete 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, infinity autobuyer ~i Math.pow(2, 32) ~x. EC1x3 should take about ~ts 360 ~. With some eternities ~ts 600 ~ to ~ts 1800 ~ in length (the later ones being longer), you should be able to get to ~i 56 ~ total theorems at roughly ~i Math.pow(2, 128) ~ EP, at which point you can buy Study 7. Once you get ~i Math.pow(2, 134) ~ EP, do EC1x4, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, complete 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, infinity ~i Math.pow(2, 32) ~x. EC1x4 should take ~ts 900 ~ to ~ts 1200 ~. Next, before getting more EP, do EC3x2, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, complete 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, infinity ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x. EC3x2 should take ~ts 600 ~ to ~ts 900 ~. In general, even-numbered ECs are harder than odd-numbered ECs, which is why EC3x2 can be done before EC2x2. You will now have ~i 8 ~ eternity challenge completions, which will allow you to produce boost power faster.</p>
    <p>After doing EC1x4 and EC3x2, you'll have another burst of progress; your first eternity might give you ~i Math.pow(2, 14) ~x EP in ~ts 300 ~. In fact, eternities from now on will often take only ~ts 300 ~. Once you get ~i Math.pow(2, 161) ~ EP, do EC2x2, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, complete 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. It should take only ~ts 60 ~ to complete; it's only being done now as opposed to earlier because progress was so fast. You should now have ~i 60 ~ total theorems; replace Study 7 by Study 12, for 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. At about ~i Math.pow(2, 182) ~ EP (you might need an eternity ~ts 600 ~ long to get this much EP), do EC3x3, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, complete 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, infinity ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x. The production of boost power helps a lot in this challenge. EC3x3 should take ~ts 480 ~ to ~ts 600 ~. At this point, eternities will get somewhat longer, getting as long as ~ts 2100 ~ to ~ts 2400 ~ before you get ~i Math.pow(2, 225) ~ EP. When you get ~i Math.pow(2, 225) ~ EP, you can do EC4x2, unlock (~ts 900 ~) and complete (~ts 420 ~) 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, (for completion) first ~i 2 ~ infinities for ~i Decimal.pow(2, 13056) ~ and ~i Decimal.pow(2, 25344) ~ IP (each about ~ts 120 ~), following infinities ~ti 30 ~. When you get ~i Math.pow(2, 239) ~ EP, do EC2x3, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, complete 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10 (~ts 180 ~). When you get ~i Math.pow(2, 260) ~ EP, do EC3x4, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, complete 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12 (~ts 60 ~).</p>
    <p>After EC3x4, change your studies to 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9. At this point, progress is so fast that you may want to do eternities ~ts 180 ~ long if you can gain ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x EP with them; from this point on, every eternity challenge completion will be a rather large benefit to progress, and progress will slow down somewhat directly before the next eternity challenge completion. At ~i Math.pow(2, 338) ~ EP, do EC2x4, unlock 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 (~ts 360 ~), complete 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 (~ts 300 ~). At ~i Math.pow(2, 386) ~ EP, do EC5x1, unlock 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, complete 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 (~ts 900 ~). At ~i Math.pow(2, 409) ~ EP, do EC6x1, unlock whatever (you have the unlock requirement already), complete 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 (~ts 720 ~). You can get here within roughly ~ts 50400 ~ from starting EC1x1.</p>
    <p>After EC6x1, you'll have ~i 16 ~ EC completions, which will give a huge multiplier (~i 125 ~x initially) to eternity gain. You'll soon (in ~ts 1200 ~ to ~ts 1500 ~) be able to gain ~i 1 ~ permanence (or slightly more). Do so. Your first priority should be getting permanence quicker, so get the first permanence upgrade so that you can get permanence ~i 2 ~x faster. When you can next get ~i 1 ~ permanence in about ~ts 600 ~, get the fourth permanence upgrade so you can get permanence about ~f 1.75 ~x faster. Then get ~i 2 ~ permanence (which takes about ~ts 900 ~) and buy the second and third permanence upgrades. While you're waiting for permanence, you can gain some EP. After buying all the permanence upgrades for the first time, you can wait to gain permanence until you can gain enough to buy each upgrade once; it's unclear if this is the most efficient thing to do but it's easier than gaining permanence more frequently. About ~ts 300 ~ after buying all the permanence upgrades for the first time, you should be able to get ~i Math.pow(2, 484) ~ EP and ~i 78 ~ total theorems. When you do, do EC4x3, unlock and complete 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, infinity ~ti 30 ~. EC4x3 should be very easy. When you get a theorem for ~i Math.pow(2, 512) ~ EP giving you ~i 80 ~ total theorems, buy Study 4, making your studies be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. Once you buy each permanence upgrade ~i 3 ~ times (so the cost of each is ~i 8 ~ permanence), switch your studies to 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12; this is better now since the third permanence upgrade is making third-row studies stronger.</p>
    <p>Once you get ~i Math.pow(2, 662) ~ EP, at which point you should have ~i 82 ~ theorems and current permanence upgrade costs should be at least ~i 16 ~ per upgrade, do EC5x2, unlock and complete 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 (completing takes ~ts 300 ~). Once you get ~i Math.pow(2, 796) ~ EP, with permanence upgrade costs at least ~i 64 ~, do EC7x1, unlock whatever, complete 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 (~ts 300 ~). Once you get ~i Math.pow(2, 962) ~ EP,  with permanence upgrade costs at least ~i 256 ~, do EC5x3, unlock and complete 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 (this isn't optimal for unlocking but unlocking is very easy so it doesn't matter, completing takes ~ts 180 ~). Once you get ~i 90 ~ theorems, buy Study 7, to make your studies be 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12. Once you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1054) ~ EP, with permanence upgrade costs at least ~i 512 ~, do EC6x2, unlock whatever, complete 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (~ts 900 ~). Once you get ~i 92 ~ total theorems, replace Study 7 by Study 2, to make your studies be 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. Once you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1344) ~ EP, with permanence upgrade costs at least ~i 1024 ~, do EC5x4, unlock and complete 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 (both quick). Once you can unlock EC7x2 (~i Decimal.pow(2, 1536) ~ EP), with permanence upgrade costs at least ~i 2048 ~, do EC7x2, unlock whatever, complete 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (~ts 240 ~). At roughly ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1664) ~ EP, replace Study 2 by Study 11 (because eternities are longer than they were before), to make your studies be 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. At this point, since you have Study 11, it's reasonable to do longer eternities that still gain a lot of EP, such as, for example, an eternity a ~ts 600 ~ long for ~i Math.pow(2, 48) ~x EP. Once you have ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1792) ~ EP (permanence upgrade costs will probably be at least ~i 4096 ~ but it doesn't matter), do EC8x1, unlock 9, 10, 11, 12, complete 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (~ts 360 ~).</p>
    <p>You now have ~i 24 ~ EC completions and gain IP without needing to infinity, so you can turn your infinity autobuyer off. You can also now view the chroma tab, but it won't be useful for a while. Do EC4x4, unlock and complete whatever (EC4x4 is so easy that you don't need any studies). Replace Study 11 by Study 2 again, since now that you don't need to infinity eternities are shorter (your first few eternities after completing EC8x1 and EC4x4 can be less than ~ts 60 ~), making your studies be 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. At about ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1984) ~ EP, however, eternities get long enough that it is again better to replace Study 2 by Study 11, making your studies be 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Once you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 2208) ~ EP, with permanence upgrade costs at least ~i Math.pow(2, 14) ~, do EC6x3, unlock whatever, complete 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 (~ts 600 ~). Replace Study 11 by Study 2, because eternities are quick. Once you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 2432) ~ EP (which should take at most ~ts 300 ~), with permanence upgrade costs at least ~i Math.pow(2, 14) ~ (as before), do EC7x3, unlock whatever, complete 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 (less than ~ts 60 ~). At roughly ~i Decimal.pow(2, 2816) ~ EP, switch back from Study 2 to Study 11 because eternities are longer. If you don't have the theorem requiring ~i Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, 3.5)) ~ boost power yet, this is a good place to get it; it's fairly quick to get and it helps a little. Once you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 3088) ~ EP, with permanence upgrade costs at least ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~, do EC7x4, unlock whatever, complete 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 (~ts 120 ~). You should now have ~i 108 ~ total theorems. Switch your studies to 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. When you get ~i 110 ~ total theorems, switch to 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 because eternities are getting longer and you can afford it. Once you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 3744) ~ EP, do EC8x2, unlock 9, 10, 11, 12, complete 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (~ts 60 ~).</p>
    <p>Fairly soon, you should get enough EP (~i Decimal.pow(2, 4096) ~ EP) to unlock chroma. Do it. You should have completed all ECs 4 times, except for EC6 (3 times) and EC8 (2 times). You can get here in about ~ts 43200 ~ from having ~i 16 ~ EC completions, or ~ts 93600 ~ from starting EC1x1.</p>

  <tab ~style.display=Tabs.currentTab() === 11 ? '' : 'none'~>
    <h3>Unlocking chroma to complexity</h3>
    <p>Chroma works as follows. Chroma builds up over time in an eternity and resets on eternity, getting ~f Math.E ~ times closer to the cap every (cap / buildup speed) seconds. Alternatively, as a formula, chroma is given below.</p>
    <p>chroma = cap * (1 - ~f Math.E ~^(-time in eternity * buildup speed / cap)).</p>
    <p>Since chroma builds up over an eternity, it is best to wait for it to build up when you unlock it, though you can gain permanence while waiting. In the eternity that you unlock it, you should try to get ~i 3072 ~ chroma and thus ~i 3072 ~ grey. This will take about ~ts 5400 ~. After this, you should be able to do quick eternities each gaining you a lot of EP, and it is thus best to again replace Study 11 by Study 2, making your studies be 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. At about ~i Decimal.pow(2, 5376) ~ EP, it's best to switch back to Study 11. Only a few eternities later, at ~i Decimal.pow(2, 5632) ~ EP, it's best to do a long eternity for some additional grey. You should try to get ~i 4224 ~ grey, which will take roughly ~ts 7200 ~ ~ts 600 ~. After that, keep gaining more EP. Once you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 6144) ~ EP, do EC8x3, unlock 9, 10, 11, 12, complete 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (~ts 60 ~). Then do EC6x4, unlock and complete whatever (it's so easy to complete that you don't need any studies).</p>
    <p>You should soon be able to get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 8192) ~ EP to unlock purple, without any very long runs. Unlock purple, start producing purple, and do an eternity long enough to let you get ~i 2048 ~ purple (which should take about ~ts 2400 ~). Note that from here on, specific amounts of colors to get and orders in which to get them are largely suggestions (though you may have trouble getting EP if you get less than suggested). If you're getting one color right after getting another, you should get orange (which you unlock later) first and purple first except for orange, but apart from that it's mostly up to you. Anyway, after getting some purple, you should quickly be able to get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 8704) ~ EP, at which point you can do EC8x4, unlock 9, 10, 11, 12, complete 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (~ts 60 ~). Now you will have all eternity challenges done, which gives you autobuyers for the things you'd otherwise buy every eternity with EP. You should be able to get here from unlocking chroma in ~ts 18000 ~.</p>
    <p>When you have ~i Decimal.pow(2, 10240) ~ EP, you should do another long eternity to get ~i 8192 ~ grey, which takes about ~ts 7200 ~ ~ts 1200 ~. Even though you have more grey than purple at this point, grey is more useful and thus more worth producing.</p>
    <p>You should soon be able to get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 12288) ~ EP to unlock orange. Unlock orange, start producing orange, and do an eternity long enough to let you get ~i 10240 ~ orange (which should take about ~ts 2700 ~). Then get ~i 10240 ~ purple (which should also take about ~ts 2700 ~). Then keep gaining EP. From here on eternities should be roughly as long as it takes to make Study 11 cap, which is currently roughly ~ts 360 ~ but will decrease with additional EP and thus additional eternity stars. You can in fact set your eternity autobuyer to time and get more EP automatically, due to your eternity generator autobuyers and other similar autobuyers. When you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 13312) ~ EP, you should get ~i 11264 ~ grey (which should take ~ts 2400 ~). Then keep gaining EP until ~i Decimal.pow(2, 14912) ~ EP, at which point you should do another longer eternity to get ~i 12800 ~ grey (which will take roughly ~ts 2520 ~).</p>
    <p>It will be somewhat hard to get ~i Decimal.pow(2, Math.pow(2, 14)) ~ EP to unlock cyan (permanence upgrade costs will probably be ~i Math.pow(2, 35) ~). Roughly when you unlock cyan, you should get enough theorems to buy Study 3, so do that. You should be able to get here from completing all eternity challenges in ~ts 28800 ~.</p>
    <p>When you unlock cyan, first get ~i 4096 ~ cyan, which should take about ~ts 360 ~. Then keep getting EP. Once you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.125 * Math.pow(2, 14)) ~ EP, get ~i Math.pow(2, 14) ~ orange (which takes roughly ~ts 2100 ~) and then ~i Math.pow(2, 14) ~ cyan (which takes roughly another ~ts 2100 ~). Then keep getting more EP. When you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.34375 * Math.pow(2, 14)) ~ EP, then get ~i 1.25 * Math.pow(2, 14) ~ grey (~ts 2160 ~). Then keep gaining EP. When you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.53125 * Math.pow(2, 14)) ~ EP, get ~i 1.375 * Math.pow(2, 14) ~ orange (~ts 1500 ~), then ~i 1.375 * Math.pow(2, 14) ~ purple, and then ~i 1.375 * Math.pow(2, 14) ~ cyan (both also ~ts 1500 ~ each). At ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.65625 * Math.pow(2, 14)) ~ EP, get ~i 1.5625 * Math.pow(2, 14) ~ grey, which should take roughly ~ts 1800 ~. When you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.8125 * Math.pow(2, 14)) ~ EP, get ~i 1.6875 * Math.pow(2, 14) ~ of orange, purple, cyan, and grey in that order, each taking about ~ts 1200 ~.</p>
    <p>When you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, Math.pow(2, 15)) ~ EP, unlock green and start producing it. Buy Study 4 and Study 7 as they become affordable. After you buy them, you'll be able to buy fourth-row studies. For now, buy only Study 16. Once you've bought Study 16 at least once, create a study preset at the bottom of the Studies tab and call it "Chroma". You'll always want to use this preset for gaining chroma. (Note that presets will generally try to spend leftover theorems, which is why loading this preset may also buy some of Studies 13-15. Since nothing is based on unspent theorems, this does no harm.) Once the next theorem from green is within ~i 1024 ~ of the chroma cap, or is over the chroma cap, stop producing green. Then create a preset and edit its studies to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12&s9,10,9,0. This preset will buy roughly the same amount of Studies 13, 14, and 15, except it will be slightly more willing to buy Study 14. Call this preset "Push". You'll always want to use this preset when you're trying to gain EP rather than chroma (well, as long as you have at least ~i 168 ~ theorems, which you do).</p>
    <p>At ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.1875 * Math.pow(2, 15)) ~ EP, get ~i 1.125 * Math.pow(2, 15) ~ of each color, in the order orange, purple, green, cyan, grey (~ts 420 ~ for each). Remember to use the Chroma preset and turn your eternity autobuyer off. Then use Push to gain more EP. At ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.53125 * Math.pow(2, 15)) ~ EP, gain ~i 1.5 * Math.pow(2, 15) ~ of each color, again in the order orange, purple, green, cyan, grey (~ts 300 ~ to ~ts 420 ~ each). At ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.8125 * Math.pow(2, 15)) ~ EP, produce ~i 1.78125 * Math.pow(2, 15) ~ of each color (~ts 240 ~ to ~ts 300 ~ for each). At ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.96875 * Math.pow(2, 15)) ~, get ~i 1.9375 * Math.pow(2, 15) ~ of each color (~ts 180 ~ each). You should soon be able to complexity for ~i 2 ~ complexity points. Do so as soon as you can. You should be able to get to this point from unlocking cyan in about ~ts 61200 ~, or from unlocking chroma in about ~ts 108000 ~.</p>

    <h3>Complexity to completing all complexity achievements</h3>
    <p>So, you've complexitied. As with eternity, this resets basically everything. You keep your slow autobuyers, and that's basically it. However, you do have ~i 2 ~ complexity points (ℂP) and ~i 1 ~ Complexity Challenge 1 (ℂC1) completion. Complexity challenges will become more relevant and thus more discussed later. For now you can ignore them.</p>
    <p>With your two ℂP, you can, and should, buy a Complexity Generator 1. Complexity generators (ℂGs) are like previous generators except that they cost complexity points. Complexity stars have a single effect, which makes complexity challenge rewards stronger. Note that you start with ~i 2 ~ complexity stars at the start of each complexity. Note also that before you eternity you have ~i 2 ~ eternity stars, but they don't do anything until you eternity. Complexity generators reset on complexity as eternity generators do on eternity.</p>
    <p>Multiplier to complexity challenge rewards from complexity stars: (log(complexity stars, ~i 2 ~)^~f 0.5 ~)x.</p>
    <p>You won't want to get more than ~i 2 ~ ℂP per complexity for a while, but just for reference, here's the ℂP formula.</p>
    <p>ℂP formula: (total EP this complexity)^~r formatWithPrecision(1 / 256, 5) ~</p>
    <p>In addition to affected complexity generator multipliers, complexities do two other things. They let you automatically complete an EC tier every ~i 8192 ~ / min(~i 256 ~, complexities) seconds, and they multiply chroma buildup speed and permanence gain by ~i 4 ~^(min(~i 256 ~, complexities)^~f 0.25 ~) (this also decreases the required eternities to gain permanence).</p>
    <p>The second complexity is so much quicker than the first that it feels qualitatively different in many areas, but much of the pre-complexity guide still applies (assume it applies unless an alternative is presented). The first infinity is much like the first infinity of the second eternity, except even faster, especially after you prestige. After you infinity, buy things in the same order as before, but do ~i 30 ~ infinities before doing any challenges. At this point all the challenges should be very easy. Some of the challenges are hard in the sense that they might take ~ts 60 ~; Challenge 2 and Challenge 7 are hard only because they still require autobuyers to be off, Challenge 3 is hard due to remaining slow initially, and Challenge 10 is hard because it still requires a lot of sacrificing.</p>
    <p>When you complete all the challenges, break infinity. Set the sacrifice autobuyer to ~i 6 ~x and set the prestige autobuyer to ~ti 1 ~. With infinities roughly ~ti 20 ~ long, you should reach IC1 in less than ~ts 300 ~. Before starting IC1, do infinities for ~i 2 ~ IP until you get ~i 256 ~ infinities. IC1 still requires you to turn autobuyers off, but you don't need to wait to prestige at all. You should be able to unlock IC2 in roughly ~ts 60 ~; do it when you can unlock it. It should be fairly easy. Don't do IC3 or IC5 as soon as you can unlock them. When you can unlock IC5, do IC3 and IC5. For IC3, turn the prestige autobuyer off and don't worry that much about when you prestige, since IC3 is easy now. For IC5, set the prestige autobuyer to ~ti 7 ~ (on, of course). Don't do any more ICs until you can eternity, in about ~ts 180 ~. When you can eternity, don't do so immediately. Instead, do IC6 (following the above strategy, but it should be easier), and do IC7 (which should be very easy). Buy a theorem with stars and a theorem with IP. When you get ~i Math.pow(2, 384) ~ IP, do IC8, but you only need ~i Math.pow(2, 20) ~ purchases if you prestige manually a few times after building up purchases rather than using the prestige autobuyer. Now do IC4, with autobuyers set to trigger every ~ti 17 ~ and prestige autobuyer set to ~ts 136 ~. IC4 should take roughly ~ts 300 ~. You should now have done all ICs.</p>
    <p>Set prestige autobuyer to ~ti 1 ~ and infinity autobuyer to ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x best of last ten. You should be able to get another theorem with stars and another theorem with IP in ~ts 300 ~ or less, giving you ~i 4 ~ total theorems. Buy Study 3. When you can get ~i 4 ~ EP, do so, and buy EG1 and a theorem with EP. It should take roughly ~ts 3600 ~ from complexity to get here.</p>
    <p>Now that you have Study 3, eternities are very fast. First infinity and all the challenges, even Challenge 7, can be completed by maxing all a few times. IC1 is both easy and the only IC worth doing. infinity autobuyer to ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x best of last ten. Keep the infinity autobuyer at ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~x best of last ten. Do eternities for ~i 2 ~ EP until you have ~i 16 ~ eternities. When you get ~i 4 ~ eternities, make your sacrifice autobuyer ~i 1 ~x. When you get ~i 6 ~ eternities, you no longer have to do IC1 yourself. When you get ~i 8 ~ eternities, make the prestige autobuyer ~i 1 ~x and the infinity autobuyer ~ti 10 ~. You should mostly save up for EG2 in this phase. These eternities will decrease in length from ~ts 240 ~ to ~ti 10 ~.</p>
    <p>After you get ~i 16 ~ eternities, set the infinity autobuyer to ~ti 5 ~, turn the eternity autobuyer off, and do a longer eternity. Even if you can't buy any theorems with EP, you should easily be able to get ~i 8 ~ theorems. When you do, buy Study 2. Eternity when it will increase your current EP to ~i 28 ~, which is enough to buy ~i 4 ~ total theorems with EP (~i 2 ~ which is already boughts, ~i 4 ~, ~i 8 ~, ~i 16 ~) and you have at least ~i 8 ~ theorems not bought with EP. This should take about ~ts 180 ~. Then do another longer eternity like the previous, with Study 1 in addition to Studies 2 and 3 this time. You should be able to get ~i 15 ~ total theorems and over ~i 50 ~ EP on eternity, at which point you should eternity, get another theorem with EP, and buy Study 4.</p>
    <p>At this point, set your infinity autobuyer to ~ti 1 ~ and your eternity autobuyer to ~i 2 ~ EP. Each eternity will take roughly ~ti 2 ~. At about ~i 64 ~ eternities they'll take only ~ti 1 ~; then change the infinity autobuyer to ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ IP. When you get ~i 256 ~ eternities, do another longer eternity like those before. Eternity when you can get ~i 512 ~ EP, which should take about ~ts 180 ~. Buy EG3. Now do another longer eternity. Set your infinity autobuyer to ~ti 7 ~ after ~ts 180 ~. Eternity when you can gain at least ~i 4096 ~ EP and have at least ~i 4 ~ boost power, which should take about ~ts 720 ~. Buy the second eternity upgrade with the EP you get. Now do an eternity to gain ~i 2545 ~ EP (~ts 180 ~), and spend them on a theorem. You should now have ~i 24 ~ theorems.</p>
    <p>Generally from here on, you'll want to aim for getting extra theorems with boost power a lot later than according to the pre-complexity guide, meaning you may have a few fewer theorems than the pre-complexity guide suggests at any given point. Get ~i 1024 ~ eternities rather than ~i 2048 ~. After you first get ~i Math.pow(2, 16) ~ EP, do another eternity to get another theorem with IP and roughly ~i Math.pow(2, 19) ~ EP so you can get ~i 28 ~ theorems.</p>
    <p>Roughly when you unlock the Eternity Producer, you will automatically complete EC1x1, which will give you another theorem. It'll also make progress significantly quicker. However, progress will slow down somewhat; the eternity after which you get EG7 will take roughly ~ts 720 ~ and will give you a theorem for getting ~i 16 ~ boost power, if you don't have that theorem already. The eternity after which you get EG8 will take roughly ~ts 420 ~ (which is slightly longer than the eternities leading up to EG8). It should take roughly ~ts 7200 ~ from eternity to get EG8, or equivalently ~ts 10800 ~ from complexity.</p>
    <p>You'll only have ~i 44 ~ total theorems for EC2x1 so you'll need to do 5, 6, 8, 9 for unlock. After completing EC2x1, you should have ~i 45 ~ theorems, and should use studies 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 due to 3 being slightly better than 7 (largely because 7 has not reached its cap). At about ~i Math.pow(2, 80) ~ EP, it is worth doing a longer eternity in which you try to get an extra theorem from ~f Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, 2.5)) ~ boost power, so that you can get ~i 46 ~ total theorems. Set your infinity autobuyer to ~ti 20 ~. Getting this theorem will take roughly ~ts 960 ~. After you get it, switch to 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and set your infinity autobuyer back to ~ti 10 ~.</p>
    <p>At this point, you should almost have another EC tier autocompletion, but it will complete EC1x2 if you do nothing, and you'll be able to complete EC1x2 soon yourself. So, you should turn EC autocomplete off until you complete EC1x2. The EC autocompletion timer will keep counting down, but if it hits ~i 0 ~ it will just store an EC autocompletion that will be used when you turn EC autocompletion back on. You should do both EC1x2 (complete 8, 9, 10, 12) and EC4x1 at ~i Math.pow(2, 97) ~ total EP, one right after the other. After EC1x2 but before EC4x1, you should turn autocomplete back on and thus automatically complete EC1x3. You should wait to do EC3x1 until ~i Math.pow(2, 109) ~ EP, wait to do EC1x4 and EC3x2 until ~i Math.pow(2, 146) ~ EP, wait to do EC3x3 until ~i Math.pow(2, 195) ~ EP, wait to do EC2x3 until ~i Math.pow(2, 252) ~ EP, and wait to do EC3x4 until ~i Math.pow(2, 281) ~ EP.</p>
    <p>After doing EC2x4, you'll be close to getting another autocompletion, which will be of EC4x3 if you don't do anything. It's worth putting this autocompletion off a bit so it's of EC4x4, by turning autocompletion off. If you can't afford Study 10 for 6x1 use Study 2 instead (so 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9). You should now have ~i 16 ~ study completions. It takes ~ts 12600 ~ from EG8 to get here, or ~ts 23400 ~ from complexity.</p>
    <p>At this point you should be gaining boost power quickly enough that it's worth getting another theorem from ~i 256 ~ boost power (~ts 300 ~ to ~ts 360 ~). Generally you should from now on use the EP requirements given in the guide for EC tiers, not the permanence upgrade requirements. After doing EC4x3, turn autocompletion back on; it will autocomplete EC4x4. Wait to do EC6x2 until ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1280) ~ EP and ~i 1024 ~ permanence upgrade costs, and use 3 instead of 11 for EC6x2 (so use 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12). You'll soon have the option of Study 2 or Study 11; since progress is faster, you almost always want to pick Study 2, even when the pre-complexity guide suggests Study 11. Use 3 instead of 11 for EC7x2 (so use 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12). After EC7x2, due to EC4x4 autocompletion you'll have ~i 24 ~ EC tiers completed.</p>
    <p>Do 7x3 as soon as you can unlock it (~i Decimal.pow(2, 1536) ~ EP) and wait to do 6x3 (which can also be done with 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 at this point) until you've done 7x3. Soon you'll get another EC tier autocompletion; if you don't do anything it will give EC6x4, which is a very good EC tier to have, so let it happen. When you get ~i 108 ~ theorems, use studies 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 and keep them even when you could swap 3 for 11; your eternities won't generally be long enough that you'd want to do that. You'll automatically complete EC6x4 after completing EC8x2, and EC6x4 should allow you to easily unlock chroma. It takes ~ts 9000 ~ from ~i 16 ~ EC completions to get here, or ~ts 32400 ~ from complexity.</p>
    <p>You'll generally need to get chroma later (in terms of EP) now than pre-complexity, and it will be roughly ~i 4 ~x faster. You can get to ~i Decimal.pow(2, 5120) ~ EP with a very small amount of grey, and even somewhat beyond it, but at roughly that point you should do a longer eternity to get ~i 1024 ~ grey (roughly ~ts 300 ~). At ~i Decimal.pow(2, 7168) ~ EP, do a longer eternity to get ~i 4096 ~ grey (~ts 1500 ~). You can do EC8x4 long before it is autocompleted. After doing EC8x4, get ~i 2048 ~ purple (~ts 300 ~). Typical eternities at this point should be about ~ts 60 ~ long. At ~i Decimal.pow(2, 10752) ~ EP, you should get ~i 6144 ~ grey (~ts 1200 ~). When you get ~i 124 ~ total theorems, buy Study 4, making your studies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. When you unlock orange, get ~i 10240 ~ orange, then ~i 10240 ~ purple, and then ~i 10240 ~ grey (~ts 600 ~ each). At ~i Decimal.pow(2, 14912) ~ EP, get ~i 12800 ~ grey, as you did pre-complexity (~ts 600 ~ to ~ts 660 ~). When you get ~i 128 ~ total theorems, swap Study 4 for Study 11, making your studies 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Study 11 is still fairly weak but it's better than Study 4.</p>
    <p>When you unlock cyan, first get ~i 8192 ~ cyan, which should take about ~ts 180 ~. Then keep getting EP. At first you should do eternities that are ~ti 30 ~ long, going up to ~ts 60 ~ when after only ~ti 30 ~ you get less than ~i Math.pow(2, 128) ~x EP per eternity. At ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.25 * Math.pow(2, 14)) ~ EP, get ~i 1.125 * Math.pow(2, 14) ~ of each color in the order orange, purple, cyan, grey (~ts 420 ~ to ~ts 480 ~ each). At ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.625 * Math.pow(2, 14)) ~ EP, get ~i 1.5 * Math.pow(2, 14) ~ of orange, purple, cyan, grey (~ts 300 ~ to ~ts 360 ~ each). When you unlock green, start producing green as you did pre-complexity, using the Chroma preset. Getting chroma of each color is now so quick that you should do it whenever you can't get ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~x EP in ~ti 30 ~. Eventually you should be able to complexity again for ~i 2 ~ ℂP, with far less trouble than the first time. Do so, since it's hard to get meaningfully farther. You can get here in ~ts 21600 ~ from unlocking chroma, or ~ts 54000 ~ from complexity.</p>
