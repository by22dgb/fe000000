  <h2>FE000000 Guide</h2>
  <h3>~r getRandomMessage() ~</h3>
  <p>This guide divides the game into pieces based (more or less) on which of the ~i 16 ~ goals in the "Goals" tab have been accomplished so far.</p>
  <h3>Before sacrifice</h3>
  <p>This part of the game is fairly simple. Start by clicking the "Main" button to go to the main tab, if you haven't already. Then buy a Generator 1 for the cost of ~i 2 ~ stars. Other generators will become affordable over time. You can hold down M to buy max of all generators. The way generators work is very simple. Each generator produces the one before it, except the first which produces stars. Buying more of a generator increases a multiplier to its production, by ~f Math.pow(2, 1 / 8) ~x per purchase.</p>
  <p>Generator inital costs: ~i 2 ~^(generator number^~i 2 ~) stars</p>
  <p>Generator cost increases per purchase: (~i 2 ~^generator number)x stars</p>
  <p>It doesn't matter very much in what order you buy generators, but generally buying a generator you don't have any of is best, and otherwise lower generators are better than higher ones. Buying max will generally automatically buy generators in this order.</p>
  <p>The autobuyer tab is also useful at this point. You can buy "slow" autobuyers for stars, and hey will each automatically buy a certain generator every ~i 16 ~ seconds (which is why they are called "slow"). They are automatically set to buy max, and you should probably keep them there because then, if they can buy more than ~i 1 ~ of a generator when they trigger, they will do so (if set to buy singles they will only buy ~i 1 ~). You should generally buy an autobuyer as soon as you have bought all generators with the same price or a lower price.</p>
  <p>Once you get ~i Math.pow(2, 64) ~ stars, several things will happen more or less at once. Firstly, you can buy the last generator, your first Generator 8. There is no Generator 9, so this is somewhat significant. Secondly, you can buy a boost. This will multiply all your generator multipliers by ~i 2 ~ when bought. Thirdly, after buying Generator 8, you will be able to sacrifice. It doesn't matter very much for what multiplier you do this the first time, but I would recommend at least ~i 4 ~x, and getting the boost with cost ~i Math.pow(2, 64) ~ stars.</p>
  <h3>Sacrifice to prestige</h3>
  <p>So, you've sacrificed. This resets all Generator 1-7 amounts, but they keep their multipliers, and Generator 8 actually has a slightly increased (~i 4 ~x) multiplier. Thus, it should only take about a minute for you to get back to the same star production you had before. After this, keep playing as before. There'll be another boost at ~i Math.pow(2, 100) ~ stars. Note that in general boosts are the most worthwhile things to buy, since they give a multiplier to all generators.</p>
  <p>Sacrifice formula: (log(stars when sacrificing, ~i 2 ~) / ~i 16 ~) sacrifice multiplier</p>
  <p>At ~i Math.pow(2, 128) ~ stars, you will be able to prestige. The slow Generator 8 autobuyer also costs ~i Math.pow(2, 128) ~ stars, so unless you're very active you probably want to buy that autobuyer first. However, after buying that, prestige as soon as you can.</p>
  <h3>Prestige to infinity</h3>
  <p>So, you've prestiged. This resets all Generator 1-8 amounts and multipliers, and your stars. However, you now have a roughly ~i 4 ~x multiplier to all generators, which will let you get far more quickly to where you were before. You also keep your slow autobuyers. Keep playing as before, perhaps sacrificing slightly later, at perhaps ~i 6 ~x (though it barely matters). Eventually you'll be able to prestige again. I'm not sure what multiplier is best to prestige for the second time, but consistently prestiging for ~i 4 ~x is not that bad. If you prestiged for ~i 4 ~x the first time, you should be able to prestige for ~i 4 ~x again at ~i Math.pow(2, 160) ~ stars, though it might be worth pushing a little further to unlock the slow boost autobuyer, the last slow autobuyer, for ~i Math.pow(2, 162) ~ stars.</p>
  <p>Prestige formula: (stars when sacrificing^~f 1 / 16 ~ / ~i 64 ~) prestige power</p>
  <p>Note that prestige power gain (and sacrifice multiplier gain, for that matter) is based on stars, so buying something right before prestiging or sacrificing can cause less of a benefit than you might hope. If you care about this, you might want to turn autobuyers off directly before each sacrifice or prestige, just to be safe.</p>
  <p>Keep prestiging for roughly ~i 4 ~x (or whatever). Sacrifice once in each prestige, a few minutes (~i 2 ~ to ~i 5 ~) after prestiging (or when progress feels like it's starting to slow). If you're close to ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ stars (if you have more than ~i Math.pow(2, 248) ~, perhaps) it's probably best not to prestige, because stuff happens at ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ stars. Specifically, stars will stop increasing. Also, the main tab will vanish, and be replaced with a message saying "The universe has collapsed due to an excess of stars." (I guess that's why stars stopped increasing.) Also, a new button will appear, saying "Infinity: Gain 2 infinity points", with additional statistics on it. Press this button, and infinity, as soon as it appears; unlike with sacrifice and prestige, there's nothing to be gained from waiting at this point.</p>
  <h3>Infinity to breaking infinity</h3>
  <p>So, you've infinitied. This resets everything prestige resets, and also resets prestige power. However, you keep your slow autobuyers. New tabs called "Infinity" and "Challenges" also unlock. On the Infinity tab, you can see that you have ~i 2 ~ infinity points and ~i 1 ~ infinity (infinities are basically a count of how many times you've infinitied). Buy an Infinity Generator 1 for the ~i 2 ~ infinity points you just got. Note that infinity generators have the same initial costs, cost increases, and multiplier per purchase as the generators you already know from pre-infinity (for clarity, in this guide the pre-infinity generators are sometimes called normal generators, though sometimes they are called generators when it is (hopefully) clear); they just cost IP instead of stars. Do another infinity, following the parts of the guide above this (except that you don't need to unlock slow autobuyers, since they're already unlocked). It'll be a lot quicker (probably at least ~i 4 ~x quicker), since you'll have a ~i 1.5 ~x multiplier to normal generators from having produced ~i 2 ~ infinity points (the formula for this multiplier is (1 + total infinity points / ~i 4 ~), capped at ~i 16 ~), and there'll be an increasing multiplier to normal generators from infinity stars, produced by your Infinity Generator 1. Due to this infinity being quicker, you don't need to wait as long to sacrifice; generally you should sacrifice once each prestige, when the number of stars you need to prestige is roughly ~i Math.pow(2, 32) ~x your current stars.</p>
  <p>After you infinity for the second time, you'll have ~i 2 ~ unspent infinity points, which you can't buy anything with. Do the same thing again but slightly quicker. Now the multiplier from total IP is ~i 2 ~x and since you have ~i 2 ~ infinities rather than ~i 1 ~, infinity stars will be produced ~i 2 ~x faster (infinity generators are all multiplied by min(~i 1 ~, infinities / ~i 256 ~), meaning that more infinities make them stronger up to ~i 256 ~), giving roughly a ~f Math.sqrt(2) ~x additional multiplier to generators. After you infinity for the third time, you'll have ~i 4 ~ IP and be able to buy Infinity Generator 1 again. Now you're ready to start doing challenges.</p>
  <p>Challenges are much like normal infinities, but they have special conditions to make them harder and give you an autobuyer (or make one of your autobuyers trigger every tick) on completion. Also, all generators are multiplied by ~i 2 ~^(completed challenges / ~i 4 ~). To do a challenge, go to the Challenges tab and click its "Start challenge" button. In theory any of the challenges could be done immediately, but some are much easier than others.</p>
  <p>Below is information on each challenge (including strategy for each challenge), followed by a description of general strategy.</p>
  <p>Challenge 1: Easy. It's not faster than a normal infinity overall, but it's close. After you have ~i 1 ~ of each generator the only generators worth buying are Generator 1 and (to a small extent) Generator 8. If you're fairly active, you might want to turn some of your autobuyers off and buy Generators 1 and 8 manually due to this. (Boosts are still worth buying though.) Also, don't sacrifice in this challenge because it's useless.</p>
  <p>Challenge 2: Hard. This challenge is slow, and doesn't speed up as much with progress as normal infinities and most challenges do. The important thing for this challenge is not to be buying things constantly (so you can't always be buying max), because buying almost anything resets the generator multipliers and they take a while to recover. At this point, buying things roughly every 16 seconds is good. You can do Challenge 2 very early if you want (buying things less frequently, maybe even only once per minute). You can buy things on some interval by setting autobuyers to trigger every ~i 16 ~ seconds, or do it manually.</p>
  <p>Challenge 3: Easy. The only hard part of this is the very start, when you don't have any generators higher than Generator 1. However, due to the very small multiplier on Generator 1 (starting at ~r formatWithPrecision(1 / 256, 5) ~), this will be the case for a few minutes at the start, which you just have to mostly wait for. Buying Generator 1 a second time for ~i 4 ~ stars will let you get Generator 2 sooner, but buying it a third time for ~i 8 ~ stars won't, so buy it twice and not a third time. Once you get ~i 16 ~ stars and buy Generator 2 it should be fairly hard to even notice you're in a challenge. After you first prestige in Challenge 3, there'll be a short wait until you can get Generator 2 again, but this time it should be less than a minute. It's worth noting that overnight, you can do Challenge 3 at any point, since its increasing multiplier to Generator 1 will have the same effect as an additional ~i 2 ~x multiplier to all generators for every ~i 2048 ~ seconds (a bit more than a half-hour) you wait. After ~i 5 ~ hours or so this is enough to easily get you to infinity.</p>
  <p>Challenge 4: Easy. This challenge doesn't have much special strategy, but you might want to wait to make a purchase of a higher generator (any generator other than Generator 1, but especially the highest few) until you can buy many at once (more explicitly, get about ~i 256 ~ times more stars than last time you bought things), since when you buy a higher generator you'll have to wait for all the ones below it to reach their previous levels again before you reach your prior star production.</p>
  <p>Challenge 5: Medium. This challenge starts out reasonable but gets harder due to you "missing" more purchases. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
  <p>Challenge 6: Hard. This challenge might seem not that bad at first, but it gets a lot harder later due to you missing ~i 2 ~ generator multipliers. It doesn't have any special strategy, though note that you can't sacrifice due to not getting Generator 8.</p>
  <p>Challenge 7: Hard. This challenge doesn't take too long (it's only a bit harder than Challenge 5 if you do it right) but it requires autobuyers to be off and has some strategy. For all prestiges but your last, buy only ~i 1 ~ of each generator (you can buy as many boosts as you want). For your last prestige (this is best to do when you have over ~i Math.pow(2, 208) ~ stars), turn the prestige autobuyer off (or otherwise make sure you don't prestige), buy as many Generator 8 as you can, then buy as many Generator 1 as you can. If you have leftover purchases, buy as many Generator 2 as you can. You should then wait until you can infinity.</p>
  <p>Challenge 8: Medium. This challenge is actually a bit faster than a normal infinity for most of the first prestige, but then gets slower at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
  <p>Challenge 9: Medium. This challenge is on the easy side of medium, and, like the other medium challenges, gets harder at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
  <p>Challenge 10: Hard. This challenge is almost like a different game. Buy ~i 1 ~ of each generator (it's all you can buy), then sacrifice. Repeat (it'll probably take ~i 64 ~ repetitions or so before you can infinity and finish the challenge, though it gets quicker with more infinity stars). Once you can sacrifice each time, only wait a few seconds to do so; waiting longer is basically a waste of time (and not waiting at all is fine).</p>
  <p>Challenge 11: Medium. As you'd probably expect, this challenge gets harder at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
  <p>Challenge 12: Hard. This is like pre-infinity, but faster and with better automation. It doesn't have any special strategy; just do what you did first infinity. It might seem like this would be a good early challenge, but actually infinity stars are useful enough that it's not that good to do early.</p>
  <p>In this paragraph, challenge orders within each sentence are suggestions and not following them probably won't make anything much harder. Do Challenge 1, Challenge 3, and Challenge 4 in ~i 3 ~ separate infinities. Then do ~i 5 ~ normal infinities (each of which is about ~i 10 ~ minutes long if you are active). Spend your ~i 16 ~ IP on an Infinity Generator 2. Then do Challenges 5, 8, 9, and 11. Spend ~i 8 ~ IP on the first infinity upgrade, increasing the multiplier per boost from ~i 2 ~x to ~f 2.25 ~x. Optionally do some more normal infinities now if you want. Do Challenges 2, 6, 7, 10, and 12, and then, having completed all challenges, break infinity in the Infinity tab.</p>
  <p>For autobuyers, you probably want to sacrifice for multiplier ~i 6 ~x, prestige for multiplier ~i 4 ~x, and, if you do Challenge 12 earlier than suggested here, infinity whenever possible, at least before breaking infinity (multiple settings lead to this).</p>
  <h3>Breaking infinity to starting Infinity Challenge 1</h3>
  <p>So, you've broken infinity. You can now get more infinity points from each infinity, if you get more stars. At the very start, you want to do slightly long infinities just to find out how many IP to infinity for so that you get the most IP/sec (infinity points per second), then do shorter runs in each of which you get that many IP. (Of course, with this guide, finding out yourself how many IP to infinity for is mostly unnecessary.) Once IP/sec starts going down, it generally won't go back up in that infinity, except sometimes if you are about to be able to buy another boost (so that might be worth checking).</p>
  <p>Note that you cannot go beyond ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~ stars in challenges even if infinity is broken, so don't try to, for example, spend months in Challenge 3 to get exponential infinity point gain. Also note that although you can now view the Infinity Challenges tab, it is not useful for a while.</p>
  <p>IP formula: stars^~r formatWithPrecision(1 / 256, 5) ~</p>
  <p>The order to buy things in is, most importantly, new infinity generators, second-most importantly, infinity upgrades (with the second being better than the first when they have the same cost), and least importantly, infinity generators you already have (these are so unimportant that even if they cost ~f 0.5 ~x the price of a new infinity generator or an infinity upgrade, you shouldn't buy them).</p>
  <p>Here are some example infinity point gain statistics (yours might be different due to having a different number of total IP or infinities). First get ~i 7 ~ IP per infinity with IP/sec going from roughly ~f 1 / 16 ~ (right after breaking infinity) to roughly ~f 1 / 8 ~. After buying the first infinity upgrade for ~i 64 ~ IP (increasing the per-boost multiplier to ~f 2.5 ~, which is a lot more useful than the first time now that you can get more boosts), get ~i 21 ~ IP per infinity with IP/sec going from roughly ~f 1 / 4 ~ to roughly ~f 11 / 16 ~.</p>
  <p>After buying Infinity Generator 3 (which, to repeat, you should do before buying the first infinity upgrade for ~i 512 ~ IP), you'll notice that IP/sec stops really going down at all (it might occasionally go down a little, but when you get your next boost it will mostly go back up). Do a single infinity for roughly ~i 10 ~ minutes, getting ~f 512 ~ IP. Buy the first infinity upgrade again. Now (you can do this slightly later or earlier) start doing infinities for ~i 2 ~ IP until you have ~i 256 ~ infinities (to increase infinity generator multipliers). This should take about ~i 7 ~ seconds per infinity at first, decreasing to ~i 4 ~. After that, again do a single long infinity, this time for roughly ~i 20 ~ minutes and for ~i 4096 ~ IP. The first two infinity upgrades should both have that cost; they're roughly equally good but the second is slightly better, so buy it. Now do another infinity for roughly ~i 10 ~ minutes, but still for ~i 4096 ~ IP, and buy the first infinity upgrade. At this point you're on your own, because a long list of exact infinities seems like too much detail. Generally try to make sure that after every infinity, with the IP you got, you unlock an infinity upgrade, unlock a new infinity generator, or can make a lot (e.g., ~i 8 ~) infinity generator purchases. On the other hand, if you're getting more than ~i 16 ~x total IP per run at this point, your infinities are probably too long. You may want to get a bit more IP than the price of whatever you want to purchase, so that you can also buy some cheap infinity generators. Infinities will get longer at first, getting as long as ~i 45 ~ minutes to ~i 2 ~ hours (how long your longest infinity is depends on how much more IP you try to infinity for each time), but past ~i Math.pow(2, 24) ~ IP infinities will get a bit shorter again, more specifically, ~i 15 ~ minutes to ~i 30 ~ minutes long. The infinity autobuyer isn't that useful in this part, but if you know how much IP you want to infinity for, then you can set it to that.</p>
  <p>At ~f Decimal.pow(2, 8192) ~ stars, which you can reach in about ~i 6 ~ hours from ~i 4096 ~ IP, Infinity Challenge 1 should become unlocked and thus possible to start. Don't start it until you get the first infinity upgrade costing ~i Math.pow(2, 33) ~ IP and the second infinity upgrade costing ~i Math.pow(2, 32) ~ IP. Note that after buying the second infinity upgrade for ~i Math.pow(2, 32) ~ IP, it will be maxed and you will not be able to buy it again its effect should now be that generators are multiplied by (infinity stars)^~f 1.5 ~, rather than the original (infinity stars)^~f 0.5 ~. Anyway, you can now start Infinity Challenge 1, so do that. The next section starts here (even though you haven't completed Infinity Challenge 1 yet) so that it has all the strategy relating to doing infinity challenges.</p>
  <p>Starting Infinity Challenge 1 to eternity</p>
  <p>Infinity challenges (or ICs) are much like challenges, except they require more stars to infinity than a normal infinity (you cannot go beyond their star requirement in them whether or not infinity is broken), and after completing them you get some new bonus to something rather than getting an autobuyer and get a multiplier to infinity generators of ~i 2 ~^(completed infinity challenges / ~i 4 ~) rather than a multiplier to normal generators. Infinity challenges can generally be grouped into the easy ones with no special strategy and the hard ones with special strategy. Unlike previous challenges, they unlock in a particular order, which is also the order you should complete them in.</p>
  <p>Infinity Challenge 1: Hard. This is a bunch of challenges combined (Challenges 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), and its strategy is mostly taken from Challenge 7, so follow the strategy given above for that challenge. The differences are that you want to spend at least ~i 5 ~ minutes before prestiging (to build up infinity stars and thus do fewer prestiges, letting you save more purchases for the last prestige), you want to spend at least ~i 1 ~ minute in each prestige (again, to do fewer prestiges), your last prestige should instead be when you reach over ~i Decimal.pow(2, 976) ~ stars (because of the goal of ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1024) ~ being far higher than the goal for Challenge 3), and that at the end you should buy Generator 6 rather than Generator 8, because Generator 8 does not exist due to Challenge 6. Despite Challenge 2 making boosts reset multipliers, boosts are worth buying as soon as you can afford them. You don't have to worry about sacrifice because, due to Challenge 6, you can't do it. It's perhaps worth noting that you can complete this challenge eventually just by buying a Generator 1 and waiting, since it includes Challenge 3, but this will take a day at least.</p>
  <p>The Infinity Challenge 1 reward uncaps the multiplier to normal generators based on total IP, which, at this point, gives normal generators at least an additional ~i Math.pow(2, 28) ~x multiplier. This means that your next few infinities will be very quick; for example, you can now get enough IP to buy Infinity Generator 6 for the first time (~i Math.pow(2, 36) ~ IP) in a ~i 3 ~-minute infinity (which is a reasonable thing to do strategically if you want). Infinities are now so short that they are a bit limited by autobuyers. In this part of the game, try to infinity for roughly ~i 16 ~x total IP each time (though it's OK to infinity earlier if that would let you get a new infinity generator that you don't have yet). You can do roughly this (definitely close enough) with the infinity autobuyer by setting its mode to "X times best of last ten" and its input to ~i 16 ~, though you'll still have to buy infinity upgrades (well, the one of them that isn't yet maxed) and infinity generators. Infinities will get slightly longer over time, going roughly from ~i 3 ~ minutes to ~i 15 ~ minutes, until you unlock Infinity Challenge 2. When you unlock Infinity Challenge 2, infinity and then start it.</p>
  <p>Infinity Challenge 2: Easy. Sacrifice formula is stars^~f 1 / 8 ~, but since prestige is square-rooted there's a fairly big overall nerf. The challenge still doesn't require any special strategy, though. However, it does take about ~i 20 ~ minutes.</p>
  <p>The Infinity Challenge 2 reward increases the sacrifice formula to stars^~f 1 / 64 ~, if it's bigger than the old formula (which it usually is). This is equivalent to almost a ~i Math.pow(2, 40) ~x multiplier to each normal generator. This will, as before, make your next few infinities far quicker. Also, due to your extra infinity generators making infinity stars increase faster and thus making longer infinities better, start to infinity for ~i 64 ~x IP rather than ~i 16 ~x. The length of infinities will increase from ~i 3 ~ minutes (right after IC2 completion) to ~i 20 ~ minutes, until you unlock Infinity Challenge 3. Infinity Challenge 3 is somewhat hard, so it might be worth getting somewhat more IP before starting it, even after you unlock it.</p>
  <p>Infinity Challenge 3: Hard. Be very careful about when you prestige; turn the prestige autobuyer off (though you can leave all others on). Prestige for at least ~i Math.pow(2, 322) ~, ~i Math.pow(2, 542) ~, ~i Math.pow(2, 641) ~ and ~i Math.pow(2, 644) ~ prestige power in your first ~i 4 ~ prestiges, in that order; after that, you won't be able to prestige again. It can take up to ~i 30 ~ minutes (mostly spent in the first prestige), but it's shorter if you got more IP before starting it.</p>
  <p>Compared to previous IC rewards, the IC3 reward is rather weak. Infinities will still be about ~i 10 ~ to ~i 15 ~ minutes long until you unlock IC4 (which should only take a few more infinities).</p>
  <p>Infinity Challenge 4: Hard. This infinity challenge is best done with your autobuyers set to trigger only every ~i 17 ~ seconds, and with your prestige autobuyer set in such a way that you gain a significant multiplier each time (setting its mode to time and its input to ~i 136 ~ is good); it then takes about ~i 30 ~ minutes. You can slightly speed it up by manually prestiging somewhat earlier for the first few prestiges, or by manually buying things quicker at the start of each prestige, which makes it somewhat shorter.</p>
  <p>Since the IC4 reward is roughly linear with time in infinity (1 + seconds in infinity / ~i 64 ~), it rewards longer infinities. Thus, it is now best to infinity for ~i 4096 ~ times best of last ten rather than ~i 64 ~ times. Infinities will still be ~i 10 ~ to ~i 25 ~ minutes long (though remember that you're making about twice as much progress per infinity) until you unlock IC5.</p>
  <p>Infinity Challenge 5: Easy. This infinity challenge doesn't have any special strategy. The infinity challenge condition means in practice that every prestige is at least about ~i 6 ~ seconds, so you might think that setting your prestige autobuyer to ~i 10 ~ seconds or something like that is good because it will stop you from doing a lot of useless short prestiges, but in reality you can leave it at ~i 4 ~x and the challenge will take about as long because you still have to wait for infinity stars to build up. This is a rather fast infinity challenge, taking only about ~i 10 ~ minutes.</p>
  <p>The IC5 reward is, initially, slightly worse than the IC3 reward, so it doesn't really change much. Continue to infinity for ~i 4096 ~x. Infinities will still be ~i 25 ~ to ~i 40 ~ minutes long until you unlock IC6, in ~i 1 ~ or ~i 2 ~ more infinities.</p>
  <p>Infinity Challenge 6: Hard. This infinity challenge requires you to turn all your autobuyers off. When the next prestige formula is normal (^~i 1 ~), get just enough stars to prestige. Generally buying ~i 1 ~ of each generator until you're close to the prestige requirement (this will probably usually have you buying ~i 1 ~ of the first ~i 7 ~ generators, but not the eighth), then buying a few boosts (but not maxing boosts) will do this. When the next prestige formula is weaker (^~f 0.5 ~), buy max repeatedly and sacrifice until stars stop going up that much, then prestige. Once you get ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.75 * Math.pow(2, 13)) ~ stars with the next prestige formula being weaker, your strategy should change. Specifically, you should prestige, do a prestige where the next prestige formula is normal but you buy max and sacrifice as if it were weaker and you prestige at ~i Decimal.pow(2, 1.75 * Math.pow(2, 13)) ~ stars again (but with the stronger prestige formula), then turn all autobuyers on. At this point you won't be able to prestige again, but you should be able to finish the infinity challenge. This challenge takes ~i 10 ~ minutes, but some of that is spent doing things manually.</p>
  <p>The IC6 reward is actually decently strong, somewhat stronger than the IC1 or IC2 rewards were on completion. It won't speed up runs as much, though, because of the IC4 reward still making long runs better. Still, infinities should only be about ~i 10 ~ to ~i 15 ~ minutes long until you unlock IC7, in ~i 1 ~ or ~i 2 ~ more infinities.</p>
  <p>Infinity Challenge 7: Easy. Prestige power is far more important than boosts, which is why this challenge is a nerf. This challenge doesn't require any special strategy, and takes about ~i 5 ~ minutes.</p>
  <p>The IC7 reward is fairly small; it's slightly larger than the IC5 reward was, but not much larger (it's about a ~i Math.pow(2, 15) ~x multiplier to normal generators). It's interesting to note that it actually gets smaller as you progress, not just in comparison to your stars but overall. Still, infinities should only be about ~i 10 ~ minutes long until you unlock IC8, in ~i 1 ~ or ~i 2 ~ more infinities.</p>
  <p>Infinity Challenge 8: Hard. This infinity challenge doesn't take too long but has strategy. First, turn all your autobuyers off, then manually buy ~i 1 ~ each of Generator 1 through Generator 7, then buy max of Generator 8. Then, without turning autobuyers on yet, set autobuyers to buy singles of Generators 1 through Generator 7 and boosts, buy max of Generator 8, sacrifice for some huge unreachable multiplier (like ~i Decimal.pow(2, 4096) ~), and prestige for ~i 1 ~x multiplier. Then turn autobuyers on. Once you have ~i Math.pow(2, 22) ~ IC8 purchases, set your non-prestige autobuyers as if you were playing normally, and set your prestige autobuyer to ~i Math.pow(2, 22) ~x. You should now be able to complete the challenge without using all your purchases, and without changing the prestige autobuyer. This challenge takes about ~i 5 ~ minutes. Remember to change your prestige autobuyer back to ~i 4 ~x after finishing the challenge. It's not clear if doing this challenge is actually worthwhile, given how close eternity is.</p>
  <p>The IC8 reward is about as strong as the IC7 reward. Infinities should only be about ~i 5 ~ minutes long until you can eternity, in ~i 1 ~ or ~i 2 ~ more infinities.</p>
  <p>Unlike stars when you could infinity, IP don't cap at ~i Math.pow(2, 256) ~. However, getting enough more to get more than ~i 2 ~ eternity points isn't worth it yet, so eternity for ~i 2 ~ eternity points as soon as you can. You can get to this point from the start of infinity challenges in about ~i 9 ~ hours.</p>
