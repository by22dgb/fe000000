  <h2>FE000000 Guide</h2>
  <h3><span id="e0"></span></h3>
  <p>This guide divides the game into pieces based on which of the <span id="e1"></span> goals in the "Goals" tab have been accomplished so far.</p>
  <h3>Before sacrifice</h3>
  <p>This part of the game is fairly simple. Start by clicking the "Main" button to go to the main tab, if you haven't already. Then buy a Generator 1 for the cost of <span id="e2"></span> stars. Other generators will become affordable over time. You can hold down M to buy max of all generators. The way generators work is very simple. Each generator produces the one before it, except the first which produces stars. Buying more of a generator increases a multiplier to its production, by <span id="e3"></span>x per purchase.</p>
  <p>It doesn't matter very much in what order you buy generators, but generally buying a generator you don't have any of is best, and otherwise lower generators are better than higher ones. Buying max will generally automatically buy generators in this order.</p>
  <p>The autobuyer tab is also useful at this point. You can buy "slow" autobuyers for stars, and hey will each automatically buy a certain generator every <span id="e4"></span> seconds (which is why they are called "slow"). They are automatically set to buy max, and you should probably keep them there because then, if they can buy more than <span id="e5"></span> of a generator when they trigger, they will do so (if set to buy singles they will only buy <span id="e6"></span>). You should generally buy an autobuyer as soon as you have bought all generators with the same price or a lower price.</p>
  <p>Once you get <span id="e7"></span> stars, several things will happen more or less at once. Firstly, you can buy the last generator, your first Generator 8. There is no Generator 9, so this is somewhat significant. Secondly, you can buy a boost. This will multiply all your generator multipliers by <span id="e8"></span> when bought. Thirdly, after buying Generator 8, you will be able to sacrifice. It doesn't matter very much for what multiplier you do this the first time, but I would recommend at least <span id="e9"></span>x, and getting the boost with cost <span id="e10"></span> stars.</p>
  <h3>Sacrifice to prestige</h3>
  <p>So, you've sacrificed. This resets all Generator 1-7 amounts, but they keep their multipliers, and Generator 8 actually has a slightly increased (<span id="e11"></span>x) multiplier. Thus, it should only take about a minute for you to get back to the same star production you had before. After this, keep playing as before. There'll be another boost at <span id="e12"></span> stars. Note that in general boosts are the most worthwhile things to buy, since they give a multiplier to all generators.</p>
  <p>Sacrifice formula: (log(stars when sacrificing, <span id="e13"></span>) / <span id="e14"></span>) sacrifice multiplier</p>
  <p>At <span id="e15"></span> stars, you will be able to prestige. The slow Generator 8 autobuyer also costs <span id="e16"></span> stars, so unless you're very active you probably want to buy that autobuyer first. However, after buying that, prestige as soon as you can.</p>
  <h3>Prestige to infinity</h3>
  <p>So, you've prestiged. This resets all Generator 1-8 amounts and multipliers, and your stars. However, you now have a roughly <span id="e17"></span>x multiplier to all generators, which will let you get far more quickly to where you were before. You also keep your slow autobuyers. Keep playing as before, perhaps sacrificing slightly later, at perhaps <span id="e18"></span>x (though it barely matters). Eventually you'll be able to prestige again. I'm not sure what multiplier is best to prestige for the second time, but consistently prestiging for <span id="e19"></span>x is not that bad. If you prestiged for <span id="e20"></span>x the first time, you should be able to prestige for <span id="e21"></span>x again at <span id="e22"></span> stars, though it might be worth pushing a little further to unlock the slow boost autobuyer, the last slow autobuyer, for <span id="e23"></span> stars.</p>
  <p>Prestige formula: (stars when sacrificing^<span id="e24"></span> / <span id="e25"></span>) prestige power</p>
  <p>Note that prestige power gain (and sacrifice multiplier gain, for that matter) is based on stars, so buying something right before prestiging or sacrificing can cause less of a benefit than you might hope. If you care about this, you might want to turn autobuyers off directly before each sacrifice or prestige, just to be safe.</p>
  <p>Keep prestiging for roughly <span id="e26"></span>x (or whatever). Sacrifice once in each prestige, a few minutes (<span id="e27"></span> to <span id="e28"></span>) after prestiging (or when progress feels like it's starting to slow). If you're close to <span id="e29"></span> stars (if you have more than <span id="e30"></span>, perhaps) it's probably best not to prestige, because stuff happens at <span id="e31"></span> stars. Specifically, stars will stop increasing. Also, the main tab will vanish, and be replaced with a message saying "The universe has collapsed due to an excess of stars." (I guess that's why stars stopped increasing.) Also, a new button will appear, saying "Infinity: Gain 2 infinity points", with additional statistics on it. Press this button, and infinity, as soon as it appears; unlike with sacrifice and prestige, there's nothing to be gained from waiting at this point.</p>
  <h3>Infinity to breaking infinity</h3>
  <p>So, you've infinitied. This resets everything prestige resets, and also resets prestige power. However, you keep your slow autobuyers. New tabs called "Infinity" and "Challenges" also unlock. On the Infinity tab, you can see that you have <span id="e32"></span> infinity points and <span id="e33"></span> infinity (infinities are basically a count of how many times you've infinitied). Buy an Infinity Generator 1 for the <span id="e34"></span> infinity points you just got. Do another infinity, following the parts of the guide above this (except that you don't need to unlock slow autobuyers, since they're already unlocked). It'll be a lot quicker (probably at least <span id="e35"></span>x quicker), since you'll have a <span id="e36"></span>x multiplier to generators (note that this does not include infinity generators) from having produced <span id="e37"></span> infinity points (the formula for this multiplier is (1 + total infinity points / <span id="e38"></span>), capped at <span id="e39"></span>), and there'll be an increasing multiplier to generators from infinity stars, produced by your Infinity Generator 1. Due to this infinity being quicker, you don't need to wait as long to sacrifice; generally you should sacrifice once each prestige, when the number of stars you need to prestige is roughly <span id="e40"></span>x your current stars.</p>
  <p>After you infinity for the second time, you'll have <span id="e41"></span> unspent infinity points, which you can't buy anything with. Do the same thing again but slightly quicker. Now the multiplier from total IP is <span id="e42"></span>x and since you have <span id="e43"></span> infinities rather than <span id="e44"></span>, infinity stars will be produced <span id="e45"></span>x faster (infinity generators are all multiplied by min(<span id="e46"></span>, infinities / <span id="e47"></span>), meaning that more infinities make them stronger up to <span id="e48"></span>), giving roughly a <span id="e49"></span>x additional multiplier to generators. After you infinity for the third time, you'll have <span id="e50"></span> IP and be able to buy Infinity Generator 1 again. Now you're ready to start doing challenges.</p>
  <p>Challenges are much like normal infinities, but they have special conditions to make them harder and give you an autobuyer (or make one of your autobuyers trigger every tick) on completion. Also, all generators are multiplied by <span id="e51"></span>^(completed challenges / <span id="e52"></span>). To do a challenge, go to the Challenges tab and click its "Start challenge" button. In theory any of the challenges could be done immediately, but some are much easier than others.</p>
  <p>Below is information on each challenge (including strategy for each challenge), followed by a description of general strategy.</p>
  <p>Challenge 1: Easy. It's not faster than a normal infinity overall, but it's close. After you have <span id="e53"></span> of each generator the only generators worth buying are Generator 1 and (to a small extent) Generator 8. If you're fairly active, you might want to turn some of your autobuyers off and buy Generators 1 and 8 manually due to this. (Boosts are still worth buying though.) Also, don't sacrifice in this challenge because it's useless.</p>
  <p>Challenge 2: Hard. This challenge is slow, and doesn't speed up as much with progress as normal infinities and most challenges do. The important thing for this challenge is not to be buying things constantly (so you can't always be buying max), because buying almost anything resets the generator multipliers and they take a while to recover. At this point, buying things roughly every 16 seconds is good. You can do Challenge 2 very early if you want (buying things less frequently, maybe even only once per minute). You can buy things on some interval by setting autobuyers to trigger every <span id="e54"></span> seconds, or do it manually.</p>
  <p>Challenge 3: Easy. The only hard part of this is the very start, when you don't have any generators higher than Generator 1. However, due to the very small multiplier on Generator 1 (starting at <span id="e55"></span>), this will be the case for a few minutes at the start, which you just have to mostly wait for. Buying Generator 1 a second time for <span id="e56"></span> stars will let you get Generator 2 sooner, but buying it a third time for <span id="e57"></span> stars won't, so buy it twice and not a third time. Once you get <span id="e58"></span> stars and buy Generator 2 it should be fairly hard to even notice you're in a challenge. After you first prestige in Challenge 3, there'll be a short wait until you can get Generator 2 again, but this time it should be less than a minute. It's worth noting that overnight, you can do Challenge 3 at any point, since its increasing multiplier to Generator 1 will have the same effect as an additional <span id="e59"></span>x multiplier to all generators for every <span id="e60"></span> seconds (a bit more than a half-hour) you wait. After <span id="e61"></span> hours or so this is enough to easily get you to infinity.</p>
  <p>Challenge 4: Easy. This challenge doesn't have much special strategy, but you might want to wait to make a purchase of a higher generator (any generator other than Generator 1, but especially the highest few) until you can buy many at once (more explicitly, get about <span id="e62"></span> times more stars than last time you bought things), since when you buy a higher generator you'll have to wait for all the ones below it to reach their previous levels again before you reach your prior star production.</p>
  <p>Challenge 5: Medium. This challenge starts out reasonable but gets harder due to you "missing" more purchases. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
  <p>Challenge 6: Hard. This challenge might seem not that bad at first, but it gets a lot harder later due to you missing <span id="e63"></span> generator multipliers. It doesn't have any special strategy, though note that you can't sacrifice due to not getting Generator 8.</p>
  <p>Challenge 7: Hard. This challenge doesn't take too long (it's only a bit harder than Challenge 5 if you do it right) but it requires autobuyers to be off and has some strategy. For all prestiges but your last, buy only <span id="e64"></span> of each generator (you can buy as many boosts as you want). For your last prestige (this is best to do when you have over <span id="e65"></span> stars), turn the prestige autobuyer off (or otherwise make sure you don't prestige), buy as many Generator 8 as you can, then buy as many Generator 1 as you can. If you have leftover purchases, buy as many Generator 2 as you can. You should then wait until you can infinity.</p>
  <p>Challenge 8: Medium. This challenge is actually a bit faster than a normal infinity for most of the first prestige, but then gets slower at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
  <p>Challenge 9: Medium. This challenge is on the easy side of medium, and, like the other medium challenges, gets harder at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
  <p>Challenge 10: Hard. This challenge is almost like a different game. Buy <span id="e66"></span> of each generator (it's all you can buy), then sacrifice. Repeat (it'll probably take <span id="e67"></span> repetitions or so before you can infinity and finish the challenge, though it gets quicker with more infinity stars). Once you can sacrifice each time, only wait a few seconds to do so; waiting longer is basically a waste of time (and not waiting at all is fine).</p>
  <p>Challenge 11: Medium. As you'd probably expect, this challenge gets harder at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
  <p>Challenge 12: Hard. This is like pre-infinity, but faster and with better automation. It doesn't have any special strategy; just do what you did first infinity. It might seem like this would be a good early challenge, but actually infinity stars are useful enough that it's not that good to do early.</p>
  <p>In this paragraph, challenge orders within each sentence are suggestions and not following them probably won't make anything much harder. Do Challenge 1, Challenge 3, and Challenge 4 in <span id="e68"></span> separate infinities. Then do <span id="e69"></span> normal infinities (each of which is about <span id="e70"></span> minutes long if you are active). Spend your <span id="e71"></span> IP on an Infinity Generator 2. Then do Challenges 5, 8, 9, and 11. Spend <span id="e72"></span> IP on the first infinity upgrade, increasing the multiplier per boost from <span id="e73"></span>x to <span id="e74"></span>x. Optionally do some more normal infinities now if you want. Do Challenges 2, 6, 7, 10, and 12, and then, having completed all challenges, break infinity in the Infinity tab.</p>
  <p>For autobuyers, you probably want to sacrifice for multiplier <span id="e75"></span>x, prestige for multiplier <span id="e76"></span>x, and, if you do Challenge 12 earlier than suggested here, infinity whenever possible, at least before breaking infinity (multiple settings lead to this).</p>
  <h3>Breaking infinity to completing an infinity challenge</h3>
  <p>So, you've broken infinity. You can now get more infinity points from each infinity, if you get more stars. At the very start, you want to do slightly long infinities just to find out how many IP to infinity for so that you get the most IP/sec (infinity points per second), then do shorter runs in each of which you get that many IP. (Of course, with this guide, finding out yourself how many IP to infinity for is mostly unnecessary.) Once IP/sec starts going down, it generally won't go back up in that infinity, except sometimes if you are about to be able to buy another boost (so that might be worth checking).</p>
  <p>The order to buy things in is, most importantly, new infinity generators, second-most importantly, infinity upgrades (with the second being better than the first when they have the same cost), and least importantly, infinity generators you already have (these are so unimportant that even if they cost <span id="e77"></span>x the price of a new infinity generator or an infinity upgrade, you shouldn't buy them).</p>
  <p>Here are some example infinity point gain statistics (yours might be different due to having a different number of total IP or infinities). First get <span id="e78"></span> IP per infinity with IP/sec going from roughly <span id="e79"></span> (right after breaking infinity) to roughly <span id="e80"></span>. After buying the first infinity upgrade for <span id="e81"></span> IP (increasing the per-boost multiplier to <span id="e82"></span>, which is a lot more useful than the first time now that you can get more boosts), get <span id="e83"></span> IP per infinity with IP/sec going from roughly <span id="e84"></span> to roughly <span id="e85"></span>.</p>
  <p>After buying Infinity Generator 3 (which, to repeat, you should do before buying the first infinity upgrade for <span id="e86"></span> IP), you'll notice that IP/sec stops really going down at all (it might occasionally go down a little, but when you get your next boost it will mostly go back up). Do a single infinity for roughly <span id="e87"></span> minutes, getting <span id="e88"></span> IP. Buy the first infinity upgrade again. Now (you can do this slightly later or earlier) start doing infinities for <span id="e89"></span> IP until you have <span id="e90"></span> infinities (to increase infinity generator multipliers). This should take about <span id="e91"></span> seconds per infinity at first, decreasing to <span id="e92"></span>. After that, again do a single long infinity, this time for roughly <span id="e93"></span> minutes and for <span id="e94"></span> IP. The first two infinity upgrades should both have that cost; they're roughly equally good but the second is slightly better, so buy it.</p>
