    <h3>Before sacrifice</h3>
    <p>This part of the game is fairly simple. Start by clicking the "Main" button to go to the main tab, if you haven't already. Then buy a Generator 1 for the cost of <span id="e2"></span> stars. Other generators will become affordable over time. You can hold down M to buy max of all generators. The way generators work is very simple. Each generator produces the one before it, except the first which produces stars. Buying more of a generator increases a multiplier to its production, by <span id="e3"></span>x per purchase.</p>
    <p>Generator inital costs: <span id="e4"></span>^(generator number^<span id="e5"></span>) stars</p>
    <p>Generator cost increases per purchase: (<span id="e6"></span>^generator number)x stars</p>
    <p>It doesn't matter very much in what order you buy generators, but generally buying a generator you don't have any of is best, and otherwise lower generators are better than higher ones. Buying max will generally automatically buy generators in this order.</p>
    <p>The autobuyer tab is also useful at this point. You can buy "slow" autobuyers for stars, and hey will each automatically buy a certain generator every <span id="e7"></span> seconds (which is why they are called "slow"). They are automatically set to buy max, and you should probably keep them there because then, if they can buy more than <span id="e8"></span> of a generator when they trigger, they will do so (if set to buy singles they will only buy <span id="e9"></span>). You should generally buy an autobuyer as soon as you have bought all generators with the same price or a lower price.</p>
    <p>Once you get <span id="e10"></span> stars, several things will happen more or less at once. Firstly, you can buy the last generator, your first Generator 8. There is no Generator 9, so this is somewhat significant. Secondly, you can buy a boost. This will multiply all your generator multipliers by <span id="e11"></span> when bought. Thirdly, after buying Generator 8, you will be able to sacrifice. It doesn't matter very much for what multiplier you do this the first time, but I would recommend at least <span id="e12"></span>x, and getting the boost with cost <span id="e13"></span> stars.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b22">
    <h3>Sacrifice to prestige</h3>
    <p>So, you've sacrificed. This resets all Generator 1-7 amounts, but they keep their multipliers, and Generator 8 actually has a slightly increased (<span id="e14"></span>x) multiplier. Thus, it should only take about a minute for you to get back to the same star production you had before. After this, keep playing as before. There'll be another boost at <span id="e15"></span> stars. Note that in general boosts are the most worthwhile things to buy, since they give a multiplier to all generators.</p>
    <p>Sacrifice formula: (log(stars when sacrificing, <span id="e16"></span>) / <span id="e17"></span>) sacrifice multiplier</p>
    <p>At <span id="e18"></span> stars, you will be able to prestige. The slow Generator 8 autobuyer also costs <span id="e19"></span> stars, so unless you're very active you probably want to buy that autobuyer first. However, after buying that, prestige as soon as you can.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b23">
    <h3>Prestige to infinity</h3>
    <p>So, you've prestiged. This resets all Generator 1-8 amounts and multipliers, and your stars. However, you now have a roughly <span id="e20"></span>x multiplier to all generators, which will let you get far more quickly to where you were before. You also keep your slow autobuyers. Keep playing as before, perhaps sacrificing slightly later, at perhaps <span id="e21"></span>x (though it barely matters). Eventually you'll be able to prestige again. I'm not sure what multiplier is best to prestige for the second time, but consistently prestiging for <span id="e22"></span>x is not that bad. If you prestiged for <span id="e23"></span>x the first time, you should be able to prestige for <span id="e24"></span>x again at <span id="e25"></span> stars, though it might be worth pushing a little further to unlock the slow boost autobuyer, the last slow autobuyer, for <span id="e26"></span> stars.</p>
    <p>Prestige formula: (stars when sacrificing^<span id="e27"></span> / <span id="e28"></span>) prestige power</p>
    <p>Note that prestige power gain (and sacrifice multiplier gain, for that matter) is based on stars, so buying something right before prestiging or sacrificing can cause less of a benefit than you might hope. If you care about this, you might want to turn autobuyers off directly before each sacrifice or prestige, just to be safe.</p>
    <p>Keep prestiging for roughly <span id="e29"></span>x (or whatever). Sacrifice once in each prestige, a few minutes (<span id="e30"></span> to <span id="e31"></span>) after prestiging (or when progress feels like it's starting to slow). If you're close to <span id="e32"></span> stars (if you have more than <span id="e33"></span>, perhaps) it's probably best not to prestige, because stuff happens at <span id="e34"></span> stars. Specifically, stars will stop increasing. Also, the main tab will vanish, and be replaced with a message saying "The universe has collapsed due to an excess of stars." (I guess that's why stars stopped increasing.) Also, a new button will appear, saying "Infinity: Gain 2 infinity points", with additional statistics on it. Press this button, and infinity, as soon as it appears; unlike with sacrifice and prestige, there's nothing to be gained from waiting at this point.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b24">
    <h3>Infinity to breaking infinity</h3>
    <p>So, you've infinitied. This resets everything prestige resets, and also resets prestige power. However, you keep your slow autobuyers. New tabs called "Infinity" and "Challenges" also unlock. On the Infinity tab, you can see that you have <span id="e35"></span> infinity points and <span id="e36"></span> infinity (infinities are basically a count of how many times you've infinitied). Buy an Infinity Generator 1 for the <span id="e37"></span> infinity points you just got. Note that infinity generators (IGs) have the same initial costs, cost increases, and multiplier per purchase as the generators you already know from pre-infinity (for clarity, in this guide the pre-infinity generators are sometimes called normal generators, though sometimes they are called generators when it is (hopefully) clear); they just cost IP instead of stars. Infinity will reset infinity stars to <span id="e38"></span> infinity generator amounts to however many you've bought, but will not reset their multipliers.</p>
    <p>There will be something on the autobuyer tab that appears to let you turn the infinity autobuyer on (checked) or off (unchecked). It indeed does, but since the infinity autobuyer is locked it doesn't do anything whether it's on or off yet. It doesn't really matter whether you turn it on or off right now; by the time you unlock it you'll be changing its other settings a lot too. In general, if an autobuyer does something that resets things in the way that (as you just saw) infinity does, it will be possible to turn it off before unlocking it, so it doesn't reset things right after it's unlocked and before it can be turned off. This is also why the above "Turn newly unlocked autobuyers on when unlocked" setting exists.</p>
    <p>Do another infinity, following the parts of the guide above this (except that you don't need to unlock slow autobuyers, since they're already unlocked). It'll be a lot quicker (probably at least <span id="e39"></span>x quicker), since you'll have a <span id="e40"></span>x multiplier to normal generators from having produced <span id="e41"></span> infinity points (the formula for this multiplier is (1 + total infinity points / <span id="e42"></span>), capped at <span id="e43"></span>), and there'll be an increasing multiplier to normal generators from infinity stars, produced by your Infinity Generator 1. Due to this infinity being quicker, you don't need to wait as long to sacrifice; generally you should sacrifice once each prestige, when the number of stars you need to prestige is roughly <span id="e44"></span>x your current stars.</p>
    <p>After you infinity for the second time, you'll have <span id="e45"></span> unspent infinity points, which you can't buy anything with. Do the same thing again but slightly quicker. Now the multiplier from total IP is <span id="e46"></span>x and since you have <span id="e47"></span> infinities rather than <span id="e48"></span>, infinity stars will be produced <span id="e49"></span>x faster (infinity generators are all multiplied by min(<span id="e50"></span>, infinities / <span id="e51"></span>), meaning that more infinities make them stronger up to <span id="e52"></span>), giving roughly a <span id="e53"></span>x additional multiplier to generators. After you infinity for the third time, you'll have <span id="e54"></span> IP and be able to buy Infinity Generator 1 again. Now you're ready to start doing challenges.</p>
    <p>Challenges are much like normal infinities, but they have special conditions to make them harder and give you an autobuyer (or make one of your autobuyers trigger every tick) on completion. Also, all generators are multiplied by <span id="e55"></span>^(completed challenges / <span id="e56"></span>). To do a challenge, go to the Challenges tab and click its "Start challenge" button. In theory any of the challenges could be done immediately, but some are much easier than others. Also, some challenges (2 and 12) start out similar to a normal infinity and don't get easier as you progress by as much as the other challenges. These are marked with "Consistent" because they take a more consistent amount of time with progress than the others. I found them hard but apparently other people don't.</p>
    <p>Below is information on each challenge (including strategy for each challenge), followed by a description of general strategy.</p>
    <p>Challenge 1: Easy. It's not faster than a normal infinity overall, but it's close. After you have <span id="e57"></span> of each generator the only generators worth buying are Generator 1 and (to a small extent) Generator 8. If you're fairly active, you might want to turn some of your autobuyers off and buy Generators 1 and 8 manually due to this. (Boosts are still worth buying though.) Also, don't sacrifice in this challenge because it's useless.</p>
    <p>Challenge 2: Consistent. This challenge is somewhat slow, and doesn't speed up as much with progress as normal infinities and most challenges do. The important thing for this challenge is not to be buying things constantly (so you can't always be buying max), because buying almost anything resets the generator multipliers and they take a while to recover. At this point, buying things roughly every 16 seconds is good. You can do Challenge 2 very early if you want (buying things less frequently, maybe even only once per minute). You can buy things on some interval by setting autobuyers to trigger every <span id="e58"></span> seconds (in which case you probably want to synchronize your slow and fast autobuyers), or do it manually.</p>
    <p>Challenge 3: Easy. The only hard part of this is the very start, when you don't have any generators higher than Generator 1. However, due to the very small multiplier on Generator 1 (starting at <span id="e59"></span>), this will be the case for a few minutes at the start, which you just have to mostly wait for. Buying Generator 1 a second time for <span id="e60"></span> stars will let you get Generator 2 sooner, but buying it a third time for <span id="e61"></span> stars won't, so buy it twice and not a third time. Once you get <span id="e62"></span> stars and buy Generator 2 it should be fairly hard to even notice you're in a challenge. After you first prestige in Challenge 3, there'll be a short wait until you can get Generator 2 again, but this time it should be less than a minute. It's worth noting that overnight, you can do Challenge 3 at any point, since its increasing multiplier to Generator 1 will have the same effect as an additional <span id="e63"></span>x multiplier to all generators for every <span id="e64"></span> seconds (a bit more than a half-hour) you wait. After <span id="e65"></span> hours or so this is enough to easily get you to infinity.</p>
    <p>Challenge 4: Easy. This challenge doesn't have much special strategy, but you might want to wait to make a purchase of a higher generator (any generator other than Generator 1, but especially the highest few) until you can buy many at once (more explicitly, get about <span id="e66"></span> times more stars than last time you bought things), since when you buy a higher generator you'll have to wait for all the ones below it to reach their previous levels again before you reach your prior star production.</p>
    <p>Challenge 5: Medium. This challenge starts out reasonable but gets harder due to you "missing" more purchases. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
    <p>Challenge 6: Hard. This challenge might seem not that bad at first, but it gets a lot harder later due to you missing <span id="e67"></span> generator multipliers. It doesn't have any special strategy, though note that you can't sacrifice due to not getting Generator 8.</p>
    <p>Challenge 7: Hard. This challenge doesn't take too long (it's only a bit harder than Challenge 5 if you do it right) but it requires autobuyers to be off and has some strategy. Don't feel worried about doing prestiges; you can do prestiges even for <span id="e68"></span>x and you'll have a lot of purchases left over if you follow the advice here. For all prestiges but your last, buy only <span id="e69"></span> of each generator (you can buy as many boosts as you want). For your last prestige (this is best to do when you have over <span id="e70"></span> stars), turn the prestige autobuyer off (or otherwise make sure you don't prestige), buy as many Generator 8 as you can, then buy as many Generator 1 as you can. If you have leftover purchases, buy as many Generator 2 as you can. You should then wait until you can infinity.</p>
    <p>Challenge 8: Medium. This challenge is actually a bit faster than a normal infinity for most of the first prestige, but then gets slower at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
    <p>Challenge 9: Medium. This challenge is on the easy side of medium, and, like the other medium challenges, gets harder at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
    <p>Challenge 10: Hard. This challenge is almost like a different game. Buy <span id="e71"></span> of each generator (it's all you can buy), then sacrifice. Repeat (it'll probably take <span id="e72"></span> repetitions or so before you can infinity and finish the challenge, though it gets quicker with more infinity stars). Once you can sacrifice each time, only wait a few seconds to do so; waiting longer is basically a waste of time (and not waiting at all is fine).</p>
    <p>Challenge 11: Medium. As you'd probably expect, this challenge gets harder at the end. It doesn't have any special strategy.</p>
    <p>Challenge 12: Consistent. This is like pre-infinity, but faster and with better automation. It doesn't have any special strategy; just do what you did first infinity. It might seem like this would be a good early challenge. However, actually infinity stars speed up a normal infinity quite a lot compared to Challenge 12, and so you can do several normal infinities in the time it'd take you to do Challenge 12. Furthermore, Challenge 12 is sped up somewhat by the multiplier to normal generators based on total infinity points. Thus, Challenge 12 is best to do either last or because you want to be able to do infinities automatically.</p>
    <p>In this paragraph, challenge orders within each sentence are suggestions and not following them probably won't make anything much harder. Do Challenge 1, Challenge 3, and Challenge 4 in <span id="e73"></span> separate infinities. Then do <span id="e74"></span> normal infinities (each of which is about <span id="e75"></span> minutes long if you are active). Spend your <span id="e76"></span> IP on an Infinity Generator 2. Then do Challenges 5, 8, 9, and 11. Spend <span id="e77"></span> IP on the first infinity upgrade, increasing the multiplier per boost from <span id="e78"></span>x to <span id="e79"></span>x. Optionally do some more normal infinities now if you want. Do Challenges 2, 6, 7, 10, and 12, and then, having completed all challenges, break infinity in the Infinity tab.</p>
    <p>For autobuyers, you probably want to sacrifice for multiplier <span id="e80"></span>x, prestige for multiplier <span id="e81"></span>x, and, if you do Challenge 12 earlier than suggested here, infinity whenever possible, at least before breaking infinity (multiple settings lead to this).</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b25">
    <h3>Breaking infinity to starting Infinity Challenge 1</h3>
    <p>So, you've broken infinity. You can now get more infinity points from each infinity, if you get more stars. At the very start, you want to do slightly long infinities just to find out how many IP to infinity for so that you get the most IP/sec (infinity points per second), then do shorter infinities in each of which you get that many IP. (Of course, with this guide, finding out yourself how many IP to infinity for is mostly unnecessary.) Once IP/sec starts going down, it generally won't go back up in that infinity, except sometimes if you are about to be able to buy another boost (so that might be worth checking).</p>
    <p>Note that you cannot go beyond <span id="e82"></span> stars in challenges even if infinity is broken, so don't try to, for example, spend months in Challenge 3 to get exponential infinity point gain. Also note that although you can now view the Infinity Challenges tab, it is not useful for a while.</p>
    <p>IP formula: stars^<span id="e83"></span></p>
    <p>The order to buy things in is, most importantly, new infinity generators, second-most importantly, infinity upgrades (with the second being better than the first when they have the same cost), and least importantly, infinity generators you already have (these are so unimportant that even if they cost <span id="e84"></span>x the price of a new infinity generator or an infinity upgrade, you shouldn't buy them).</p>
    <p>Here are some example infinity point gain statistics (yours might be different due to having a different number of total IP or infinities). First get <span id="e85"></span> IP per infinity with IP/sec going from roughly <span id="e86"></span> (right after breaking infinity) to roughly <span id="e87"></span>. After buying the first infinity upgrade for <span id="e88"></span> IP (increasing the per-boost multiplier to <span id="e89"></span>, which is a lot more useful than the first time now that you can get more boosts), get <span id="e90"></span> IP per infinity with IP/sec going from roughly <span id="e91"></span> to roughly <span id="e92"></span>.</p>
    <p>After buying Infinity Generator 3 (which, to repeat, you should do before buying the first infinity upgrade for <span id="e93"></span> IP), you'll notice that IP/sec stops really going down at all (it might occasionally go down a little, but when you get your next boost it will mostly go back up). Do a single infinity for roughly <span id="e94"></span> minutes, getting <span id="e95"></span> IP. Buy the first infinity upgrade again. Now (you can do this slightly later or earlier) start doing infinities for <span id="e96"></span> IP until you have <span id="e97"></span> infinities (to increase infinity generator multipliers). This should take about <span id="e98"></span> seconds per infinity at first, decreasing to <span id="e99"></span>. After that, again do a single long infinity, this time for roughly <span id="e100"></span> minutes and for <span id="e101"></span> IP. The first two infinity upgrades should both have that cost; they're roughly equally good but the second is slightly better, so buy it. Now do another infinity for roughly <span id="e102"></span> minutes, but still for <span id="e103"></span> IP, and buy the first infinity upgrade.</p>
    <p>At this point you're on your own, because a long list of exact infinities seems like too much detail. Generally try to make sure that after every infinity, with the IP you got, you unlock an infinity upgrade, unlock a new infinity generator, or can make a lot (e.g., <span id="e104"></span>) infinity generator purchases. On the other hand, if you're getting more than <span id="e105"></span>x total IP per infinity at this point, your infinities are probably too long. You may want to get a bit more IP than the price of whatever you want to purchase, so that you can also buy some cheap infinity generators. Infinities will get longer at first, getting as long as <span id="e106"></span> minutes to <span id="e107"></span> hours (how long your longest infinity is depends on how much more IP you try to infinity for each time), but past <span id="e108"></span> IP infinities will get a bit shorter again, more specifically, <span id="e109"></span> minutes to <span id="e110"></span> minutes long. The infinity autobuyer isn't that useful in this part, but if you know how much IP you want to infinity for, then you can set it to that.</p>
    <p>At <span id="e111"></span> stars, which you can reach in about <span id="e112"></span> hours from <span id="e113"></span> IP, Infinity Challenge 1 should become unlocked and thus possible to start. Don't start it until you get the first infinity upgrade costing <span id="e114"></span> IP and the second infinity upgrade costing <span id="e115"></span> IP. Note that after buying the second infinity upgrade for <span id="e116"></span> IP, it will be maxed and you will not be able to buy it again its effect should now be that generators are multiplied by (infinity stars)^<span id="e117"></span>, rather than the original (infinity stars)^<span id="e118"></span>. Anyway, you can now start Infinity Challenge 1, so do that. The next section starts here (even though you haven't completed Infinity Challenge 1 yet) so that it has all the strategy relating to doing infinity challenges.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b26">
    <h3>Starting Infinity Challenge 1 to eternity</h3>
    <p>Infinity challenges (or ICs) are much like challenges, except they require more stars to infinity than a normal infinity (you cannot go beyond their star requirement in them whether or not infinity is broken), and after completing them you get some new bonus to something rather than getting an autobuyer and get a multiplier to infinity generators of <span id="e119"></span>^(completed infinity challenges / <span id="e120"></span>) rather than a multiplier to normal generators. Infinity challenges can generally be grouped into the easy ones with no special strategy and the hard ones with special strategy. Unlike previous challenges, they unlock in a particular order, which is also the order you should complete them in.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 1: Hard. This is a bunch of challenges combined (Challenges 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), and its strategy is mostly taken from Challenge 7, so follow the strategy given above for that challenge. The differences are that you want to spend at least <span id="e121"></span> minutes before prestiging (to build up infinity stars and thus do fewer prestiges, letting you save more purchases for the last prestige), you want to spend at least <span id="e122"></span> minute in each prestige (again, to do fewer prestiges), your last prestige should instead be when you reach over <span id="e123"></span> stars (because of the goal of <span id="e124"></span> being far higher than the goal for Challenge 3), and that at the end you should buy Generator 6 rather than Generator 8, because Generator 8 does not exist due to Challenge 6. Despite Challenge 2 making boosts reset multipliers, boosts are worth buying as soon as you can afford them. You don't have to worry about sacrifice because, due to Challenge 6, you can't do it. Infinity Challenge 1 should take <span id="e125"></span> to <span id="e126"></span> minutes. It's perhaps worth noting that you can complete this challenge eventually just by buying a Generator 1 and waiting, since it includes Challenge 3, but this will take a day at least.</p>
    <p>The Infinity Challenge 1 reward uncaps the multiplier to normal generators based on total IP, which, at this point, gives normal generators at least an additional <span id="e127"></span>x multiplier. This means that your next few infinities will be very quick; for example, you can now get enough IP to buy Infinity Generator 6 for the first time (<span id="e128"></span> IP) in a <span id="e129"></span>-minute infinity (which is a reasonable thing to do strategically if you want). Infinities are now so short that they are a bit limited by autobuyers. In this part of the game, try to infinity for roughly <span id="e130"></span>x total IP each time (though it's OK to infinity earlier if that would let you get a new infinity generator that you don't have yet). You can do roughly this (definitely close enough) with the infinity autobuyer by setting its mode to "X times best of last ten" and its input to <span id="e131"></span>, though you'll still have to buy infinity upgrades (well, the one of them that isn't yet maxed) and infinity generators. Infinities will get slightly longer over time, going roughly from <span id="e132"></span> minutes to <span id="e133"></span> minutes, until you unlock Infinity Challenge 2. When you unlock Infinity Challenge 2, infinity and then start it.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 2: Easy. Sacrifice formula is stars^<span id="e134"></span>, but since prestige is square-rooted there's a fairly big overall nerf. The challenge still doesn't require any special strategy, though. However, it does take about <span id="e135"></span> minutes.</p>
    <p>The Infinity Challenge 2 reward increases the sacrifice formula to stars^<span id="e136"></span>, if it's bigger than the old formula (which it usually is). This is equivalent to almost a <span id="e137"></span>x multiplier to each normal generator. This will, as before, make your next few infinities far quicker. Also, due to your extra infinity generators making infinity stars increase faster and thus making longer infinities better, start to infinity for <span id="e138"></span>x IP rather than <span id="e139"></span>x. The length of infinities will increase from <span id="e140"></span> minutes (right after IC2 completion) to <span id="e141"></span> minutes, until you unlock Infinity Challenge 3. Infinity Challenge 3 is somewhat hard, so it might be worth getting somewhat more IP before starting it, even after you unlock it.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 3: Hard. Be very careful about when you prestige; turn the prestige autobuyer off (though you can leave all others on). Prestige for at least <span id="e142"></span>, <span id="e143"></span>, <span id="e144"></span> and <span id="e145"></span> prestige power in your first <span id="e146"></span> prestiges, in that order; after that, you won't be able to prestige again. It can take up to <span id="e147"></span> minutes (mostly spent in the first prestige), but it's shorter if you got more IP before starting it.</p>
    <p>Compared to previous IC rewards, the IC3 reward is rather weak. Infinities will still be about <span id="e148"></span> to <span id="e149"></span> minutes long until you unlock IC4 (which should only take a few more infinities).</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 4: Hard. This infinity challenge is best done with your autobuyers set to trigger only every <span id="e150"></span> seconds, and with your prestige autobuyer set in such a way that you gain a significant multiplier each time (setting its mode to time and its input to <span id="e151"></span> is good); it then takes about <span id="e152"></span> minutes. You can slightly speed it up by manually prestiging somewhat earlier for the first few prestiges, or by manually buying things quicker at the start of each prestige, which makes it somewhat shorter.</p>
    <p>Since the IC4 reward is roughly linear with time in infinity (1 + seconds in infinity / <span id="e153"></span>), it rewards longer infinities. Thus, it is now best to infinity for <span id="e154"></span> times best of last ten rather than <span id="e155"></span> times. Infinities will still be <span id="e156"></span> to <span id="e157"></span> minutes long (though remember that you're making about twice as much progress per infinity) until you unlock IC5.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 5: Easy. This infinity challenge doesn't have any special strategy. The infinity challenge condition means in practice that every prestige starts with a few useless seconds, so you might think that setting your prestige autobuyer to <span id="e158"></span> seconds or something like that is good because it will stop you from doing a lot of useless short prestiges, but in reality you can leave it at <span id="e159"></span>x and the challenge will take about as long because you still have to wait for infinity stars to build up. This is a rather fast infinity challenge, taking only about <span id="e160"></span> minutes.</p>
    <p>The IC5 reward is, initially, slightly worse than the IC3 reward, so it doesn't really change much. Continue to infinity for <span id="e161"></span>x. Infinities will still be <span id="e162"></span> to <span id="e163"></span> minutes long until you unlock IC6, in <span id="e164"></span> or <span id="e165"></span> more infinities.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 6: Hard. This infinity challenge requires you to turn all your autobuyers off. When the next prestige formula is normal (^<span id="e166"></span>), get just enough stars to prestige. Generally buying <span id="e167"></span> of each generator until you're close to the prestige requirement (this will probably usually have you buying <span id="e168"></span> of the first <span id="e169"></span> generators, but not the eighth), then buying a few boosts (but not maxing boosts) will do this. When the next prestige formula is weaker (^<span id="e170"></span>), buy max repeatedly and sacrifice until stars stop going up that much, then prestige. Once you get <span id="e171"></span> stars with the next prestige formula being weaker, your strategy should change. Specifically, you should prestige, do a prestige where the next prestige formula is normal but you buy max and sacrifice as if it were weaker and you prestige at <span id="e172"></span> stars again (but with the stronger prestige formula), then turn all autobuyers on. At this point you won't be able to prestige again, but you should be able to finish the infinity challenge. This challenge takes <span id="e173"></span> minutes, but some of that is spent doing things manually.</p>
    <p>The IC6 reward is actually decently strong, somewhat stronger than the IC1 or IC2 rewards were on completion. It won't speed up infinities as much, though, because of the IC4 reward still making long infinities better. Still, infinities should only be about <span id="e174"></span> to <span id="e175"></span> minutes long until you unlock IC7, in <span id="e176"></span> or <span id="e177"></span> more infinities.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 7: Easy. Prestige power is far more important than boosts, which is why this challenge is a nerf. This challenge doesn't require any special strategy, and takes about <span id="e178"></span> minutes.</p>
    <p>The IC7 reward is fairly small; it's slightly larger than the IC5 reward was, but not much larger (it's about a <span id="e179"></span>x multiplier to normal generators). It's interesting to note that it actually gets smaller as you progress, not just in comparison to your stars but overall. Still, infinities should only be about <span id="e180"></span> minutes long until you unlock IC8, in <span id="e181"></span> or <span id="e182"></span> more infinities.</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 8: Hard. This infinity challenge doesn't take too long but has strategy. First, turn all your autobuyers off, then manually buy <span id="e183"></span> each of Generator 1 through Generator 7, then buy max of Generator 8. Then, without turning autobuyers on yet, set autobuyers to buy singles of Generators 1 through Generator 7 and boosts, buy max of Generator 8, sacrifice for some huge unreachable multiplier (like <span id="e184"></span>), and prestige for <span id="e185"></span>x multiplier. Then turn autobuyers on. Once you have <span id="e186"></span> IC8 purchases, set your non-prestige autobuyers as if you were playing normally, and set your prestige autobuyer to <span id="e187"></span>x. You should now be able to complete the challenge without using all your purchases, and without changing the prestige autobuyer. This challenge takes about <span id="e188"></span> minutes. Remember to change your prestige autobuyer back to <span id="e189"></span>x after finishing the challenge. It's not clear if doing this challenge is actually worthwhile, given how close eternity is.</p>
    <p>The IC8 reward is about as strong as the IC7 reward. Infinities should only be about <span id="e190"></span> to <span id="e191"></span> minutes long until you can eternity, in <span id="e192"></span> or <span id="e193"></span> more infinities.</p>
    <p>Unlike stars when you could infinity, IP don't cap at <span id="e194"></span>. However, getting enough more to get more than <span id="e195"></span> eternity points isn't worth it yet, so eternity for <span id="e196"></span> eternity points as soon as you can. You can get to this point from the start of infinity challenges in about <span id="e197"></span> hours.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b27">
    <h3>Eternity to completing all eternity milestones</h3>
    <p>So, you've eternitied. This resets basically everything. You keep your slow autobuyers, and that's basically it. However, with your <span id="e198"></span> eternity points (EP) you can, and should, buy an Eternity Generator 1. Eternity generators (EGs) are like normal generators and infinity generators except that they cost eternity points. Eternity stars have two effects: a multiplier and a power. Note that you start with <span id="e199"></span> eternity stars at the start of each eternity.</p>
    <p>Multiplier from eternity stars: (eternity stars)x. Eternity stars and eternity generators reset on eternity to the same extent infinity stars and infinity generators reset on infinity.</p>
    <p>Power from eternity stars: <span id="e200"></span> + log(log(eternity stars, 2), 2) / <span id="e201"></span></p>
    <p>You won't want to get more than <span id="e202"></span> EP per eternity for a while, but just for reference, here's the EP formula.</p>
    <p>EP formula: (total IP this eternity)^<span id="e203"></span></p>
    <p>The starting benefits from milestones are below, in the hopes that they will be convenient.</p>
    <p>Milestone formulas: <span id="e204"></span>^(min(<span id="e205"></span>, eternities)) starting stars, <span id="e206"></span>^(min(<span id="e207"></span>, eternities / <span id="e208"></span>)) starting IP, min(<span id="e209"></span>, eternities)^<span id="e210"></span> starting infinities</p>
    <p>The second eternity is much like the first, except far quicker, and generally following the guide above works. Following are the important differences, together with other important things to note.</p>
    <p>You should do your first infinity in Challenge 12, because the condition does nothing and you'll get an autobuyer and a small multiplier for it. You don't need to unlock slow autobuyers again, since they're already unlocked. Challenge 1 is comparatively harder, because the multiplier from eternity stars only applies to <span id="e211"></span> generator (albeit ^<span id="e212"></span>); you may thus want to do Challenge 1 as a medium-difficulty challenge rather than an easy challenge, and do an extra normal infinity instead so you still have Infinity Generator 2 before starting the medium-difficulty challenges. Challenge 2 is a tiny bit more annoying due to not being quicker by as much as the rest of the game is; you may want to do it last, and to do more normal infinities before doing it, but you will be able to buy things more often (every <span id="e213"></span> seconds is fine). <span id="e214"></span> total infinities is enough to max the multiplier to normal generators from total IP, which helps for that. Right after breaking infinity, the best IP per infinity is somewhat higher; for example, <span id="e215"></span> IP on your first infinity after breaking infinity is reasonable. Don't forget to get <span id="e216"></span> infinities; this isn't a difference, but it's one of the easier things to forget because not doing it slows down progress rather than stopping it (these infinities will probably be far quicker than before, though, which is a difference).</p>
    <p>Infinity Challenge 1 doesn't require as much waiting before prestiging; <span id="e217"></span> minute should be more than enough. More generally, almost every infinity challenge is far quicker. For the sake of speed, it may be best to infinity and start an infinity challenge immediately after unlocking it rather than waiting for your infinity autobuyer's requirement. After Infinity Challenge 1, due to how quick infinities are, it's better to set prestige to <span id="e218"></span> seconds than to <span id="e219"></span>x. Due to eternity stars, setting your infinity autobuyer to <span id="e220"></span>x best of last ten is good even just after Infinity Challenge 1, for the rest of the eternity. If you want, you can do slightly better manually early on by doing slightly longer infinities, because of how powerful Infinity Challenge 1 is (also note what was said above about starting an infinity challenge immediately after unlock). Infinity Challenge 4 is not far quicker; it's not worth doing and should be skipped. Because you start with <span id="e221"></span> stars, Infinity Challenge 5 doesn't have as much of a delay at the start of every prestige, so you can leave the prestige autobuyer at <span id="e222"></span> seconds and it'll be fine. Infinity Challenge 8 is not far quicker because its speed depends on autobuyer speed, and definitely should be skipped. Make sure to buy a theorem (in the Studies tab) for <span id="e223"></span> stars and to buy another for <span id="e224"></span> IP; it's not crucial that you do this now, but you'll have to do it in one of the next <span id="e225"></span> eternities (counting this one) and there's no reason not to do it now. Generally, from now on, you should buy theorems with stars and IP as soon as they become affordable, even if this isn't stated explicitly.</p>
    <p>Overall, your second eternity can be as short as <span id="e226"></span> to <span id="e227"></span> hours.</p>
    <p>It is best to spend your next <span id="e228"></span> EP (including the <span id="e229"></span> you just got) on <span id="e230"></span> theorems, for <span id="e231"></span> EP and <span id="e232"></span> EP (it doesn't really matter whether you buy both theorems at once, or buy the first earlier and the second later). This will give you <span id="e233"></span> total theorems, which will let you buy Study 3, which will speed up eternities a lot. So don't buy Eternity Generator 1 again until you have <span id="e234"></span> total theorems.</p>
    <p>Your third eternity is a lot like the second, except that, from the <span id="e235"></span>-eternity eternity milestone, you start with all challenges (but not infinity challenges) completed, with all fast autobuyers, and with infinity broken, and since eternity generators are all multiplied by min(<span id="e236"></span>, eternities / <span id="e237"></span>), eternity stars will produce <span id="e238"></span>x as fast. The strategy is similar to that for second eternity, except that you don't need to do challenges, and there's thus no reason to do your first infinity in Challenge 12. Remember to set your prestige autobuyer back to <span id="e239"></span>x until you complete IC1. You still want to do some early infinities for <span id="e240"></span> IP, perhaps until <span id="e241"></span> infinities and <span id="e242"></span> total IP. Once you're done with those early infinities, you can (though this is not strictly necessary) infinity a few times for <span id="e243"></span> to <span id="e244"></span> IP per infinity, then do more quick infinities to get up to <span id="e245"></span> infinities (infinity length will get down to roughly <span id="e246"></span> second by the end of this). Infinity Challenge 5 now has basically no delay at the start of each prestige.</p>
    <p>Overall, your third eternity can be as short as <span id="e247"></span> to <span id="e248"></span> hours.</p>
    <p>Your fourth eternity is almost the same as the third, except that, from the <span id="e249"></span>-eternity eternity milestone, you can buy an Infinity Generator 1 before you infinity. Again, remember to set your prestige autobuyer back to <span id="e250"></span>x until you complete IC1. This eternity will be about the same length as the previous one.</p>
    <p>Now you can finally buy another theorem for <span id="e251"></span> EP and buy Study 3. This will make eternities a lot quicker. Getting <span id="e252"></span> infinities is now unnecessary. The <span id="e253"></span>-eternity eternity milestone lets you set the sacrifice autobuyer to <span id="e254"></span>x. You can prestige and infinity manually (prestiges should be roughly <span id="e255"></span> second long and infinities should be roughly <span id="e256"></span> seconds long), or you can set your prestige autobuyer to <span id="e257"></span> second and your infinity autobuyer to <span id="e258"></span>x best of last ten. You should still eternity for <span id="e259"></span> EP. This eternity should take about <span id="e260"></span> minutes (maybe slightly quicker), mostly limited by autobuyers and (if you prestige and infinity manually) manual speed.</p>
    <p>Now keep doing eternities much like the last. The <span id="e261"></span>-eternity eternity milestone gives you some infinities (initally <span id="e262"></span>), which helps a bit but not that much. When you have <span id="e263"></span> eternities, you can (and should) get another EG1. The <span id="e264"></span>-eternity eternity milestone automatically completes ICs, which means you don't need to do them yourself and is thus very helpful. At this point, eternities are about <span id="e265"></span> minutes long and you can just stay on the infinity tab. The <span id="e266"></span>-eternity eternity milestone is just autobuyers (on by default) and thus is not much of a speedup. The <span id="e267"></span>-eternity eternity milestone lets you set the prestige autobuyer to prestige for a <span id="e268"></span>x multiplier, which is a very big speedup. You can also set the infinity autobuyer to infinity every <span id="e269"></span> seconds. You'll still need to buy infinity generators until you get autobuyers for them, though. Eternities should now be about <span id="e270"></span> to <span id="e271"></span> minutes long. When you have <span id="e272"></span> eternities, you can, and should, buy EG2. After about <span id="e273"></span> to <span id="e274"></span> minutes from <span id="e275"></span> eternity, you'll have <span id="e276"></span> eternities and thus will have completed all eternity milestones.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b28">
    <h3>Completing all eternity milestones to unlocking the Eternity Producer</h3>
    <p>In this section of the game, you'll start to have several studies at once and to need to determine which studies are best. Generally, a multiplier to infinity generators is <span id="e277"></span> times better than the same multiplier to normal generators, and a multiplier to eternity generators is slightly better than (however many eternity generators you have any of) times better than the same multiplier to infinity generators. Of course, the studies that multiply normal generators generally have the biggest multipliers, and those that multiply eternity generators generally have the smallest multipliers, so determining which is best requires some mental arithemetic (and of course, multipliers should be compared logarithmically; a <span id="e278"></span>x multiplier is only <span id="e279"></span>x as good as a <span id="e280"></span>x multiplier to the same thing, since <span id="e281"></span> is <span id="e282"></span>^<span id="e283"></span>).</p>
    <p>First, turn off your eternity autobuyer. It's good in general, but there are advantages to doing a somewhat long eternity now. It gives less EP/second, but it makes Study 3 stronger and lets you get more theorems. Getting to <span id="e284"></span> IP should be enough to get another theorem with stars, get another theorem with IP, and noticeably increase Study 3's multiplier without taking too long (<span id="e285"></span> to <span id="e286"></span> minutes), so do that. Note that you should buy the theorems with stars and IP as soon as you can afford them, as stated above. Then start doing quick eternities for <span id="e287"></span> EP again. In addition to this being efficient for IP/second, it makes EGs slightly stronger via more eternities, and gives you more starting benefits (in particular starting IP), which makes eternities even quicker.</p>
    <p>As for what to spend your EP on, first buy the first eternity upgrade once, then start saving for theorems with EP. After buying a theorem for <span id="e288"></span> EP and another theorem for <span id="e289"></span> EP, you can buy Study 4 to speed up quick eternities even more.</p>
    <p>At some point soon (you could do this immediately, or make it slightly faster by getting more eternities first), you should try to do another longer eternity to get more theorems. For this longer eternity, you'll want Studies 1 and 3, rather than 3 and 4, so respec your studies and buy Studies 1 and 3. You should be able to get <span id="e290"></span> more theorems with stars and also another theorem with infinity points, for <span id="e291"></span> total theorems, fairly quickly. After about <span id="e292"></span> minutes (right before the second theorem bought with stars) you should switch the infinity autobuyer to <span id="e293"></span> seconds since IP gain will start to slow down. Overall this eternity should take about <span id="e294"></span> minutes. Remember to set your eternity autobuyer back to <span id="e295"></span> EP, and also you'll want to respec and buy Studies 3 and 4. Additionally, you can now set the infinity autobuyer to <span id="e296"></span> seconds. Furthermore, soon you'll be able to buy another theorem for <span id="e297"></span> EP. Do so, and buy Study 1 (in addition to <span id="e298"></span> and <span id="e299"></span>, which you already have).</p>
    <p>Eternities are useful enough that you should try to get <span id="e300"></span> of them right now. They should only take roughly <span id="e301"></span> seconds each. Buy EG2 again, then buy EG1 as it becomes affordable. From now on, advice about buying eternity upgrades and generators is similar to that about buying infinity upgrades and generators. The third and second upgrades start out good (the third especially so) but get worse per purchase; the first starts out bad but gets better per purchase (though it can only be purchased <span id="e302"></span> times, at which point its effect is ^<span id="e303"></span>, making the per-purchase eternity generator multiplier <span id="e304"></span>x).</p>
    <p>Eternities will start to be <span id="e305"></span> seconds long once you have roughly <span id="e306"></span> of them. This makes it even easier to get to <span id="e307"></span> eternities.</p>
    <p>Once you have <span id="e308"></span> eternities, keep doing quick <span id="e309"></span>-EP eternities, and save EP to buy another theorem for <span id="e310"></span> EP. Once you can buy that theorem, buy it (giving you <span id="e311"></span> total theorems), and do another longer eternity with Studies 1, 2, and 3, and with your infinity autobuyer set to <span id="e312"></span> seconds. As before, switch the infinity autobuyer to <span id="e313"></span> seconds after <span id="e314"></span> minutes. You should be able to, within about <span id="e315"></span> minutes from the start of the eternity, buy another theorem with stars and <span id="e316"></span> more theorems with IP, for a total of <span id="e317"></span> theorems. You can now buy Study 4, so do that. Stay in this eternity until you can buy another theorem with stars, for a total of <span id="e318"></span> theorems.</p>
    <p>Now you can do slightly longer eternities for maximum EP/second. Set your infinity autobuyer to <span id="e319"></span> seconds and your eternity autobuyer to <span id="e320"></span> EP. You should get about <span id="e321"></span> EP/second by doing this. Save EP for EG3 (<span id="e322"></span> EP), after buying which you should get <span id="e323"></span> EP/minute, then for the first eternity upgrade for the second time (<span id="e324"></span> EP). Then buy all eternity generators costing up to <span id="e325"></span> EP in any order you want. By the end of this, you'll be getting about <span id="e326"></span> EP/second.</p>
    <p>Now save up for the second eternity upgrade. After buying it, do a longer eternity. Set your infinity autobuyer to <span id="e327"></span> seconds and turn off your eternity autobuyer.</p>
    <p>After about <span id="e328"></span> minute, you will get more than <span id="e329"></span> boosts and thus start producing boost power. Each boost above <span id="e330"></span> boosts (that is, max(0, boosts - <span id="e331"></span>) boosts)) produces <span id="e332"></span> boost power per second, so boost power gain is (max(0, boosts - <span id="e333"></span>) boosts)) * <span id="e334"></span>) per second. Boost power resets on eternity, but not on infinity. Boost power provides a multiplier to boosts based on its amount (<span id="e335"></span> + log(amount, <span id="e336"></span>)). You also get theorems (which you keep on eternity) at certain thresholds of boost power. Boost power makes long eternities decent (but still not yet as good as short eternities for EP/second) and is eventually a major reason that they become better.</p>
    <p><span id="e337"></span> minutes after the start of the eternity, you should be able to buy another theorem with stars and <span id="e338"></span> more theorems with IP, and should also have gotten <span id="e339"></span> extra theorems from boost power for a total of <span id="e340"></span> theorems. You'd like to get a few more theorems, and progress is slowing down, so set the infinity autobuyer to <span id="e341"></span> seconds instead of <span id="e342"></span>.</p>
    <p><span id="e343"></span> minutes later (<span id="e344"></span> minutes after the start of the eternity), you should be able to buy another theorem with <span id="e345"></span> stars and should also have gotten <span id="e346"></span> more extra theorem from boost power (if you have less than <span id="e347"></span> boost power, wait until you have <span id="e348"></span>), for <span id="e349"></span> total theorems. Now you should eternity, buy a theorem with EP for <span id="e350"></span> total theorems, and buy Studies 2, 3, 4, and 8.</p>
    <p>Do eternities for <span id="e351"></span> EP (and infinities for <span id="e352"></span> IP with the mode being amount) until you have <span id="e353"></span> eternities, to make Study 7 slightly stronger. Each eternity should be about <span id="e354"></span> seconds long. After that, change the infinity autobuyer to <span id="e355"></span> seconds, turn the eternity autobuyer off, and buy Studies 5, 6, 7, and 8. You'll be doing another longer eternity, since longer eternities are now the best way to get more EP/second. However, you should now have almost enough EP to buy the first eternity upgrade again for <span id="e356"></span> EP, so, before doing your longer eternity, eternity as soon as doing so will give you enough EP to buy that upgrade, and then buy it (it should only take <span id="e357"></span> to <span id="e358"></span> minutes).</p>
    <p><span id="e359"></span> minutes after the start of the eternity, you should be able to buy another theorem with IP and should set your infinity autobuyer to <span id="e360"></span> seconds. <span id="e361"></span> minutes later (<span id="e362"></span> minutes after the start of the eternity), you should be able to buy another theorem with stars and should've gotten (or be about to get) another theorem from boost power (bringing you up to <span id="e363"></span> total theorems). Don't eternity yet, though. <span id="e364"></span> minutes later (<span id="e365"></span> minutes after the start of the eternity), you should be able to eternity for <span id="e366"></span> EP. Do that, and buy the third eternity upgrade (which is at this point even better than EG4). If you have a small amount of extra EP, buy cheap eternity generators. Also, instead of Studies 5, 6, 7, and 8, buy Studies 3, 5, 6, and 8, which you can now do with your additional theorems.</p>
    <p>Do another longer eternity, with the infinity autobuyer set to <span id="e367"></span> seconds. After about <span id="e368"></span> minutes, you should be able to again eternity for <span id="e369"></span> EP. Do that, and buy EG4. Do another eternity for <span id="e370"></span> EP (which should take about <span id="e371"></span> minutes), and buy the first eternity upgrade and another theorem for <span id="e372"></span> EP.</p>
    <p>In your next eternity, you should get <span id="e373"></span> EP, which will take <span id="e374"></span> to <span id="e375"></span> minutes. During this eternity, you'll get another theorem with IP, for a total of <span id="e376"></span> theorems. Spend the EP you get on unlocking the Eternity Producer. You can reach this point about <span id="e377"></span> hours after getting all eternity milestones.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b29">
    <h3>Unlocking the Eternity Producer to starting Eternity Challenge 1</h3>
    <p>The Eternity Producer produces eternities, and gives a multiplier to eternity generators based on their amount. Upgrades for it (to produce more eternities and increase the multiplier) are generally fairly minor: worse than an eternity upgrade with the same cost, but better than an eternity generator. Note that with more eternities (from, for example, waiting overnight), progress will be significantly faster and the time it takes to do things after getting a large number of additional eternities will likely be less than the time given below.</p>
    <p>Do another long eternity (about <span id="e378"></span> hour) to get another theorem with stars and another extra theorem from boost power, increasing your total theorems to <span id="e379"></span>. Since this eternity is long and you are going for boost power in it, it is wise to set your infinity autobuyer to <span id="e380"></span> seconds so you get boost power for more of each infinity. Now do an eternity (about <span id="e381"></span> minutes long) for <span id="e382"></span> EP (with infinity autobuyer back at <span id="e383"></span> seconds) with Studies 5, 6, 8, and 10. Buy the second eternity upgrade (rather than the first). At this point, you should replace Study 10 with Study 9 instead. Do another eternity for <span id="e384"></span> EP, which should take about <span id="e385"></span> minutes, and buy the first eternity upgrade. Do another eternity for <span id="e386"></span> EP, which should take about <span id="e387"></span> minutes, and buy EG5.</p>
    <p>From now on, you can choose when to do eternities yourself. Generally try to get between <span id="e388"></span>x and <span id="e389"></span>x your total EP in each eternity, with smaller multipliers like <span id="e390"></span>x generally being better early and larger multipliers like <span id="e391"></span>x generally being better late. If you're about to be able to get a theorem, wait for it. Generally, almost all eternities should be less than <span id="e392"></span> hour.</p>
    <p>Once you have <span id="e393"></span> theorems and EG6, you should buy Study 10 instead of Study 8. The Study 10 multiplier raised ^<span id="e394"></span> is a bit weaker than the Study 8 multiplier, but due to the various things eternity stars do, Study 10 is still slightly better. Roughly when you buy a theorem for <span id="e395"></span> EP, Study 8 becomes slightly better than Study 10 again (and remains better for a while), so you should replace Study 10 by Study 8 again. While trying to get <span id="e396"></span> EP (or, slightly earlier, <span id="e397"></span> EP), there's a small wall and so you'll probably need to do a long eternity (<span id="e398"></span> hours); if you set the infinity autobuyer to <span id="e399"></span> seconds during this eternity (not after it), you should be able to get a theorem for <span id="e400"></span> boost power, perhaps by making the eternity somewhat longer (<span id="e401"></span> hours). Getting this theorem (and the theorem for <span id="e402"></span> EP) will let you buy Study 7, in addition to 5, 6, 8, and 9. After about <span id="e403"></span> EP, eternities should become a lot faster than they were immediately before (they should now be <span id="e404"></span> to <span id="e405"></span> minutes long), and you should be able to get as far as buying the second eternity upgrade for <span id="e406"></span> EP in about <span id="e407"></span> hour. Once you buy the second eternity upgrade for <span id="e408"></span> EP, you should do an eternity with Studies 5, 6, 8, and 9 and unlock Eternity Challenge 1 when possible. After unlocking Eternity Challenge 1, start it. You can reach this point in about <span id="e409"></span> hours from unlocking the Eternity Producer.</p>

    <h3>Starting Eternity Challenge 1 to unlocking chroma</h3>
    <p>Eternity challenges (or ECs) are somewhat like challenges and infinity challenges. There are several important differences, however. Eternity challenges require a certain amount of IP to eternity and complete the challenge, rather than a certain amount of stars to infinity and complete the challenge. They have infinity-challenge-like rewards that make various things stronger, but they can each be completed up to <span id="e410"></span> times, having a higher goal amount of IP each time and getting a stronger reward for each time completed. Finally, they have a requirement (depending on times completed) and a cost in theorems (fixed for each challenge) to unlock, and must be explicitly unlocked to be entered. Note that you can respec studies in an eternity challenge if you want. You will get the theorems you paid to unlock an eternity challenge back when you complete it or respec your eternity challenge (which will lock it again).</p>
    <p>To recap, you can do EC1 the first time (EC1x1) at <span id="e411"></span> EP, unlocking it with Studies 5, 6, 8, and 9. Once you unlock it, respec your studies and buy Studies 3, 8, 10, and 12. Within EC1x1, you should infinity for <span id="e412"></span>x best of last ten rather than, for example, every <span id="e413"></span> seconds. This challenge should take about <span id="e414"></span> to <span id="e415"></span> minutes to complete.</p>
    <p>Switch back to <span id="e416"></span>-second infinities and Studies 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 after completing EC1x1. You should be able to get <span id="e417"></span> EP and buy EG8 with it in a <span id="e418"></span>-minute to <span id="e419"></span>-minute eternity. EG8 will make eternities somewhat faster (<span id="e420"></span> minutes). When (slightly later) you get <span id="e421"></span> total theorems, replace Study 7 by Study 10, making your studies be 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. Once you get roughly <span id="e422"></span> EP, you can do EC2x1 (EC2 for the first time). Unlock it with Studies 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and complete it with Studies 6, 8, 9, and 10. Unlocking and completing it should each take less than <span id="e423"></span> minutes. After completing EC2x1, switch back to Studies 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. At this point, your eternities should generally be for between <span id="e424"></span>x and <span id="e425"></span>x total EP. Getting <span id="e426"></span> EP is somewhat hard (it requires a <span id="e427"></span> minute eternity), but once you get that much EP you can do EC1x2 (EC1 for the second time). Unlock with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (which should take roughly <span id="e428"></span> minutes), and complete with 8, 10, 11, and 12 (if you already have <span id="e429"></span> eternities, you can use 8, 9, 10, and 12 instead and thus not have to wait for 11 to build up). As before, infinity for <span id="e430"></span>x best of last ten within EC1x2. EC1x2 will take about <span id="e431"></span> hour to complete.</p>
    <p>Next, for maximum speed, you should actually do EC4x1. EC3x1 has a slightly lower unlock requirement and cost than EC4x1, but is significantly harder (though both have similar requirements for completion). I do regret that EC4x1 comes before EC3x1, though in general completion x of EC4 is harder than completion x of EC3. For EC4x1, you should get <span id="e432"></span> total EP (via a roughly-<span id="e433"></span>-minute eternity), and unlock and complete with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. When doing EC4x1, wait <span id="e434"></span> minutes before your first infinity to let boost power and eternity stars build up, and then do <span id="e435"></span>-second eternities. You should easily be able to complete EC4x1 in roughly <span id="e436"></span> minutes. Then do EC3x1. Unlock with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and complete with 3, 8, 9, 12. Infinity for <span id="e437"></span>x best of last ten within EC3x1. EC3x1 should take at most roughly <span id="e438"></span> minutes, though it is faster if you have more eternities; it will take only <span id="e439"></span> to <span id="e440"></span> minutes if you have <span id="e441"></span> eternities.</p>
    <p>After doing EC3x1 and EC4x1 (whatever order you do them in), you'll have a burst of progress; it's now better to do eternities for <span id="e442"></span>x to <span id="e443"></span>x in general, though your first eternity after EC3x1 and EC4x1 might give you even more EP than that (your eternities should be at least <span id="e444"></span> minutes long). At about <span id="e445"></span> total EP (by which point progress should still be rather fast, with eternities lasting less than <span id="e446"></span> minutes) do EC1x3, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, complete 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, infinity autobuyer <span id="e447"></span>x. EC1x3 should take about <span id="e448"></span> minutes. With some eternities <span id="e449"></span> to <span id="e450"></span> minutes in length (the later ones being longer), you should be able to get to <span id="e451"></span> total theorems at roughly <span id="e452"></span> IP, at which point you can buy Study 7. Once you get <span id="e453"></span> EP, do EC1x4, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, complete 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, infinity <span id="e454"></span>x. EC1x4 should take <span id="e455"></span> to <span id="e456"></span> minutes. Next, before getting more EP, do EC3x2, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, complete 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, infinity <span id="e457"></span>x. EC3x2 should take <span id="e458"></span> to <span id="e459"></span> minutes. In general, even-numbered ECs are harder than odd-numbered ECs, which is why EC3x2 can be done before EC2x2. You will now have <span id="e460"></span> eternity challenge completions, which will allow you to produce boost power faster.</p>
    <p>After doing EC1x4 and EC3x2, you'll have another burst of progress; your first eternity might give you <span id="e461"></span>x EP in <span id="e462"></span> minutes. In fact, eternities from now on will often take only <span id="e463"></span> minutes until. Once you get <span id="e464"></span> EP, do EC2x2, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, complete 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. It should take only <span id="e465"></span> minute to complete; it's only being done now as opposed to earlier because progress was so fast. You should now have <span id="e466"></span> total theorems; replace Study 7 by Study 12, for 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. At about <span id="e467"></span> EP (you might need a <span id="e468"></span>-minute eternity to get this much EP), do EC3x3, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, complete 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, infinity <span id="e469"></span>x. The production of boost power helps a lot in this challenge. EC3x3 should take <span id="e470"></span> to <span id="e471"></span> minutes. At this point, eternities will get somewhat longer, getting as long as <span id="e472"></span> to <span id="e473"></span> minutes before you get <span id="e474"></span> EP. When you get <span id="e475"></span> EP, you can do EC4x2, unlock (<span id="e476"></span> minutes) and complete (<span id="e477"></span> minutes) 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, (for completion) first <span id="e478"></span> infinities for <span id="e479"></span> and <span id="e480"></span> IP (each about <span id="e481"></span> minutes), following infinities <span id="e482"></span> seconds. When you get <span id="e483"></span> EP, do EC2x3, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, complete 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10 (<span id="e484"></span> minutes). When you get <span id="e485"></span> EP, do EC3x4, unlock 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, complete 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12 (<span id="e486"></span> minute).</p>
    <p>After EC3x4, change your studies to 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9. At this point, progress is so fast that you may want to do <span id="e487"></span>-minute eternities if you can gain <span id="e488"></span>x EP with them; from this point on, every eternity challenge completion will be a rather large benefit to progress, and progress will slow down somewhat directly before the next eternity challenge completion. At <span id="e489"></span> EP, do EC2x4, unlock 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 (<span id="e490"></span> minutes), complete 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 (<span id="e491"></span> minutes). At <span id="e492"></span> EP, do EC5x1, unlock 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, complete 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 (<span id="e493"></span> minutes). At <span id="e494"></span> EP, do EC6x1, unlock whatever (you have the unlock requirement already), complete 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 (<span id="e495"></span> minutes). You can get here within roughly <span id="e496"></span> hours from starting EC1x1.</p>
    <p>After EC6x1, you'll have <span id="e497"></span> EC completions, which will give a huge multiplier (<span id="e498"></span>x initially) to eternity gain. You'll soon (in <span id="e499"></span> to <span id="e500"></span> minutes) be able to gain <span id="e501"></span> permanence (or slightly more). Do so. Your first priority should be getting permanence quicker, so get the first permanence upgrade so that you can get permanence <span id="e502"></span>x faster. When you can next get <span id="e503"></span> permanence in about <span id="e504"></span> minutes, get the fourth permanence upgrade so you can get permanence about <span id="e505"></span>x faster. Then get <span id="e506"></span> permanence (which takes about <span id="e507"></span> minutes) and buy the second and third permanence upgrades. While you're waiting for permanence, you can gain some EP. After buying all the permanence upgrades for the first time, you can wait to gain permanence until you can gain enough to buy each upgrade once; it's unclear if this is the most efficient thing to do but it's easier than gaining permanence more frequently. About <span id="e508"></span> minutes after buying all the permanence upgrades for the first time, you should be able to get <span id="e509"></span> EP and <span id="e510"></span> total theorems. When you do, do EC4x3, unlock and complete 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, infinity <span id="e511"></span> seconds. EC4x3 should be very easy. When you get a theorem for <span id="e512"></span> EP giving you <span id="e513"></span> total theorems, buy Study 4, making your studies be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. Once you buy each permanence upgrade <span id="e514"></span> times (so the cost of each is <span id="e515"></span> permanence), switch your studies to 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12; this is better now since the third permanence upgrade is making third-row studies stronger.</p>
    <p>Once you get <span id="e516"></span> EP, at which point you should have <span id="e517"></span> theorems and current permanence upgrade costs should be at least <span id="e518"></span> per upgrade, do EC5x2, unlock and complete 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 (completing takes <span id="e519"></span> minutes). Once you get <span id="e520"></span> EP, with permanence upgrade costs at least <span id="e521"></span>, do EC7x1, unlock whatever, complete 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 (<span id="e522"></span> minutes). Once you get <span id="e523"></span> EP,  with permanence upgrade costs at least <span id="e524"></span>, do EC5x3, unlock and complete 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 (this isn't optimal for unlocking but unlocking is very easy so it doesn't matter, completing takes <span id="e525"></span> minutes). Once you get <span id="e526"></span> theorems, buy Study 7, to make your studies be 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12. Once you get <span id="e527"></span> EP, with permanence upgrade costs at least <span id="e528"></span>, do EC6x2, unlock whatever, complete 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (<span id="e529"></span> minutes). Once you get <span id="e530"></span> total theorems, replace Study 7 by Study 2, to make your studies be 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. Once you get <span id="e531"></span> EP, with permanence upgrade costs at least <span id="e532"></span>, do EC5x4, unlock and complete 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 (both quick). Once you can unlock EC7x2 (<span id="e533"></span> EP), with permanence upgrade costs at least <span id="e534"></span>, do EC7x2, unlock whatever, complete 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (<span id="e535"></span> minutes). At roughly <span id="e536"></span> EP, replace Study 2 by Study 11 (because eternities are longer than they were before), to make your studies be 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. At this point, since you have Study 11, it's reasonable to do longer eternities that still gain a lot of EP, such as, for example, a <span id="e537"></span>-minute eternity for <span id="e538"></span>x EP. Once you have <span id="e539"></span> EP (permanence upgrade costs will probably be at least <span id="e540"></span> but it doesn't matter), do EC8x1, unlock 9, 10, 11, 12, complete 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (<span id="e541"></span> minutes).</p>
    <p>You now have <span id="e542"></span> EC completions and gain IP without needing to infinity, so you can turn your infinity autobuyer off. You can also now view the chroma tab, but it won't be useful for a while. Do EC4x4, unlock and complete whatever (EC4x4 is so easy that you don't need any studies). Replace Study 11 by Study 2 again, since now that you don't need to infinity eternities are shorter (your first few eternities after completing EC8x1 and EC4x4 can be less than <span id="e543"></span> minute), making your studies be 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. At about <span id="e544"></span> EP, however, eternities get long enough that it is again better to replace Study 2 by Study 11, making your studies be 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Once you get <span id="e545"></span> EP, with permanence upgrade costs at least <span id="e546"></span>, do EC6x3, unlock whatever, complete 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 (<span id="e547"></span> minutes). Replace Study 11 by Study 2, because eternities are quick. Once you get <span id="e548"></span> EP (which should take at most <span id="e549"></span> minutes), with permanence upgrade costs at least <span id="e550"></span> (as before), do EC7x3, unlock whatever, complete 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 (less than <span id="e551"></span> minute). At roughly <span id="e552"></span> EP, switch back from Study 2 to Study 11 because eternities are longer. If you don't have the theorem requiring <span id="e553"></span> boost power yet, this is a good place to get it; it's fairly quick to get and it helps a little. Once you get <span id="e554"></span> EP, with permanence upgrade costs at least <span id="e555"></span>, do EC7x4, unlock whatever, complete 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 (<span id="e556"></span> minutes). You should now have <span id="e557"></span> total theorems. Switch your studies to 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. When you get <span id="e558"></span> total theorems, switch to 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 because eternities are getting longer and you can afford it. Once you get <span id="e559"></span> EP, do EC8x2, unlock 9, 10, 11, 12, complete 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (<span id="e560"></span> minute).</p>
    <p>Fairly soon, you should get enough EP (<span id="e561"></span> EP) to unlock chroma. Do it. You should have completed all ECs 4 times, except for EC6 (3 times) and EC8 (2 times). You can get here in about <span id="e562"></span> hours from having <span id="e563"></span> EC completions, or <span id="e564"></span> hours from starting EC1x1.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="b31">
    <h3>Unlocking chroma to complexity</h3>
    <p>Chroma works as follows. Chroma builds up over time in an eternity and resets on eternity, getting <span id="e565"></span> times closer to the cap every (cap / buildup speed) seconds. Alternatively, as a formula, chroma is given below.</p>
    <p>chroma = cap * (1 - <span id="e566"></span>^(-time in eternity * buildup speed / cap)).</p>
    <p>Since chroma builds up over an eternity, it is best to wait for it to build up when you unlock it, though you can gain permanence while waiting. In the eternity that you unlock it, you should try to get <span id="e567"></span> chroma and thus <span id="e568"></span> grey. This will take about <span id="e569"></span> hours. After this, you should be able to do quick eternities each gaining you a lot of EP, and it is thus best to again replace Study 11 by Study 2, making your studies be 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. At about <span id="e570"></span> EP, it's best to switch back to Study 11. Only a few eternities later, at <span id="e571"></span> EP, it's best to do a long eternity for some additional grey. You should try to get <span id="e572"></span> grey, which will take roughly <span id="e573"></span> hours <span id="e574"></span> minutes. After that, keep gaining more EP. At Once you get <span id="e575"></span> EP, do EC8x3, unlock 9, 10, 11, 12, complete 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (<span id="e576"></span> minute). Then do EC6x4, unlock and complete whatever (it's so easy to complete that you don't need any studies).</p>
    <p>You should soon be able to get <span id="e577"></span> EP to unlock purple, without any very long runs. Unlock purple, start producing purple, and do an eternity long enough to let you get <span id="e578"></span> purple (which should take about <span id="e579"></span> minutes). Note that from here on, specific amounts of colors to get and orders in which to get them are largely suggestions (though you may have trouble getting EP if you get less than suggested). If you're getting one color right after getting another, you should get orange (which you unlock later) first and purple first except for orange, but apart from that it's mostly up to you. Anyway, after getting some purple, you should quickly be able to get <span id="e580"></span> EP, at which point you can do EC8x4, unlock 9, 10, 11, 12, complete 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (<span id="e581"></span> minute). Now you will have all eternity challenges done, which gives you autobuyers for the things you'd otherwise buy every eternity with EP. When you have <span id="e582"></span> EP, you should do another long eternity to get <span id="e583"></span> grey, which takes about <span id="e584"></span> hours <span id="e585"></span> minutes. Even though you have more grey than purple at this point, grey is more useful and thus more worth producing.</p>
    <p>You should soon be able to get <span id="e586"></span> EP to unlock orange. Unlock orange, start producing orange, and do an eternity long enough to let you get <span id="e587"></span> orange (which should take about <span id="e588"></span> minutes). Then get <span id="e589"></span> purple (which should also take about <span id="e590"></span> minutes). Then keep gaining EP. From here on eternities should be roughly as long as it takes to make Study 11 cap, which is currently roughly <span id="e591"></span> minutes but will decrease with additional EP and thus additional eternity stars. You can in fact set your eternity autobuyer to time and get more EP automatically, due to your eternity generator autobuyers and other similar autobuyers. When you get <span id="e592"></span> EP, at which point you should get <span id="e593"></span> grey (which should take <span id="e594"></span> minutes). Then keep gaining EP until <span id="e595"></span> EP, at which point you should do another longer eternity to get <span id="e596"></span> grey (which will take roughly <span id="e597"></span> minutes).</p>
    <p>It will be somewhat hard to get <span id="e598"></span> EP to unlock cyan (permanence upgrade costs will probably be <span id="e599"></span>). Roughly when you unlock cyan, you should get enough theorems to buy Study 3, so do that. When you unlock cyan, first get <span id="e600"></span> cyan, which should take about <span id="e601"></span> minutes. Then keep getting EP. Once you get <span id="e602"></span> EP, get <span id="e603"></span> orange (which takes roughly <span id="e604"></span> minutes) and then <span id="e605"></span> cyan (which takes roughly another <span id="e606"></span> minutes). Then keep getting more EP. When you get <span id="e607"></span> EP, then get <span id="e608"></span> grey (<span id="e609"></span> minutes). Then keep gaining EP. When you get <span id="e610"></span> EP, get <span id="e611"></span> orange (<span id="e612"></span> minutes), then <span id="e613"></span> purple, and then <span id="e614"></span> cyan (both also <span id="e615"></span> minutes each). At <span id="e616"></span> EP, get <span id="e617"></span> grey, which should take roughly <span id="e618"></span> minutes. When you get <span id="e619"></span> EP, get <span id="e620"></span> of orange, purple, cyan, and grey in that order, each taking about <span id="e621"></span> minutes.</p>
    <p>When you get <span id="e622"></span> EP, unlock green and start producing it. Buy Study 4 and Study 7 as they become affordable. After you buy them, you'll be able to buy fourth-row studies. For now, buy only Study 16. Once you've bought Study 16 at least once, create a study preset at the bottom of the Studies tab and call it "Chroma". You'll always want to use this preset for gaining chroma. Once the next theorem from green is within <span id="e623"></span> of the chroma cap, or is over the chroma cap, stop producing green. Then create a preset and edit its studies to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12&s9,10,9,0. This preset will buy roughly the same amount of Studies 13, 14, and 15, except it will be slightly more willing to buy Study 14. Call this preset "Push". You'll always want to use this preset when you're trying to gain EP rather than chroma (well, as long as you have at least <span id="e624"></span> theorems, which you do).</p>
