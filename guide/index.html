  <h2>FE000000 Guide</h2>
  <h3><span id="e0"></span></h3>
  <p>This guide divides the game into pieces based on which of the <span id="e1"></span> goals in the "Goals" tab have been accomplished so far.</p>
  <h3>Before sacrifice</h3>
  <p>This part of the game is fairly simple. Start by clicking the "Main" button to go to the main tab, if you haven't already. Then buy a Generator 1 for the cost of <span id="e2"></span> stars. Other generators will become affordable over time. You can hold down M to buy max of all generators. The way generators work is very simple. Each generator produces the one before it, except the first which produces stars. Buying more of a generator increases a multiplier to its production, by <span id="e3"></span>x per purchase.</p>
  <p>It doesn't matter very much in what order you buy generators, but generally buying a generator you don't have any of is best, and otherwise lower generators are better than higher ones. Buying max will generally automatically buy generators in this order.</p>
  <p>The autobuyer tab is also useful at this point. You can buy "slow" autobuyers for stars, and hey will each automatically buy a certain generator every <span id="e4"></span> seconds (which is why they are called "slow"). They are automatically set to buy max, and you should probably keep them there because then, if they can buy more than <span id="e5"></span> of a generator when they trigger, they will do so (if set to buy singles they will only buy <span id="e6"></span>). You should generally buy an autobuyer as soon as you have bought all generators with the same price or a lower price.</p>
  <p>Once you get <span id="e7"></span> stars, several things will happen more or less at once. Firstly, you can buy the last generator, your first Generator 8. There is no Generator 9, so this is somewhat significant. Secondly, you can buy a boost. This will multiply all your generator multipliers by <span id="e8"></span> when bought. Thirdly, after buying Generator 8, you will be able to sacrifice. It doesn't matter very much for what multiplier you do this the first time, but I would recommend at least <span id="e9"></span>x, and getting the boost with cost <span id="e10"></span> stars.</p>
  <h3>Sacrifice to prestige</h3>
  <p>So, you've sacrificed. This resets all Generator 1-7 amounts, but they keep their multipliers, and Generator 8 actually has a slightly increased (<span id="e11"></span>x) multiplier. Thus, it should only take about a minute for you to get back to the same star production you had before. After this, keep playing as before. There'll be another boost at <span id="e12"></span> stars. Note that in general boosts are the most worthwhile things to buy, since they give a multiplier to all generators.</p>
  <p>Sacrifice formula: (log(stars when sacrificing, <span id="e13"></span>) / <span id="e14"></span>) sacrifice multiplier</p>
  <p>At <span id="e15"></span> stars, you will be able to prestige. The slow Generator 8 autobuyer also costs <span id="e16"></span> stars, so unless you're very active you probably want to buy that autobuyer first. However, after buying that, prestige as soon as you can.</p>
  <h3>Prestige to infinity</h3>
  <p>So, you've prestiged. This resets all Generator 1-8 amounts and multipliers, and your stars. However, you now have a roughly <span id="e17"></span>x multiplier to all generators, which will let you get far more quickly to where you were before. You also keep your slow autobuyers. Keep playing as before, perhaps sacrificing slightly later, at perhaps <span id="e18"></span>x (though it barely matters). Eventually you'll be able to prestige again. I'm not sure what multiplier is best to prestige for the second time, but consistently prestiging for <span id="e19"></span>x is not that bad. If you prestiged for <span id="e20"></span>x the first time, you should be able to prestige for <span id="e21"></span>x again at <span id="e22"></span> stars, though it might be worth pushing a little further to unlock the slow boost autobuyer, the last slow autobuyer, for <span id="e23"></span> stars.</p>
  <p>Prestige formula: (stars when sacrificing^<span id="e24"></span> / <span id="e25"></span>) prestige power</p>
  <p>Note that prestige power gain (and sacrifice multiplier gain, for that matter) is based on stars, so buying something right before prestiging or sacrificing can cause less of a benefit than you might hope. If you care about this, you might want to turn autobuyers off directly before each sacrifice or prestige, just to be safe.</p>
  <p>Keep prestiging for roughly <span id="e26"></span>x (or whatever). Sacrifice once in each prestige, a few minutes (<span id="e27"></span> to <span id="e28"></span>) after prestiging (or when progress feels like it's starting to slow). If you're close to <span id="e29"></span> stars (if you have more than <span id="e30"></span>, perhaps) it's probably best not to prestige, because stuff happens at <span id="e31"></span> stars. Specifically, stars will stop increasing. Also, the main tab will vanish, and be replaced with a message saying "The universe has collapsed due to an excess of stars." (I guess that's why stars stopped increasing.) Also, a new button will appear, saying "Infinity: Gain 2 infinity points", with additional statistics on it. Press this button, and infinity, as soon as it appears; unlike with sacrifice and prestige, there's nothing to be gained from waiting at this point.</p>
  <h3>Infinity to breaking infinity</h3>
  <p>So, you've infinitied. This resets everything prestige resets, and also resets prestige power. However, you keep your slow autobuyers. New tabs called "Infinity" and "Challenges" also unlock. On the Infinity tab, you can see that you have <span id="e32"></span> infinity points and <span id="e33"></span> infinity (infinities are basically a count of how many times you've infinitied). Buy an Infinity Generator 1 for the <span id="e34"></span> infinity points you just got. Do another infinity, following the parts of the guide above this (except that you don't need to unlock slow autobuyers, since they're already unlocked). It'll be a lot quicker (probably at least <span id="e35"></span>x quicker), since you'll have a <span id="e36"></span>x multiplier to generators (note that this does not include infinity generators) from having produced <span id="e37"></span> infinity points, and there'll be an increasing multiplier to generators from infinity stars, produced by your Infinity Generator 1.</p>
  <p>After you infinity for the second time, you'll have <span id="e38"></span> unspent infinity points, which you can't buy anything with. Do the same thing again but slightly quicker. Now the multiplier from total IP is <span id="e39"></span>x and since you have <span id="e40"></span> infinities rather than <span id="e41"></span>, infinity stars will be produced <span id="e42"></span>x faster, giving roughly a <span id="e43"></span>x additional multiplier to generators. After you infinity for the third time, you'll have <span id="e44"></span> IP and be able to buy Infinity Generator 1 again. Now you're ready to start doing challenges.</p>
  <p>Challenges are much like normal infinities, but they have special conditions to make them harder and give you an autobuyer (or make one of your autobuyers trigger every tick) on completion. Also, all generators are multiplied by <span id="e45"></span>^(completed challenges / <span id="e46"></span>). To do a challenge, go to the Challenges tab and click its "Start challenge" button. In theory any of the challenges could be done immediately, but some are much easier than others.</p>
  <p>The <span id="e47"></span> challenges described immediately below (1, 4, 3) can be done in any order without much trouble. I'm not sure if the order below is in fact quickest.</p>
  <p>First (with <span id="e48"></span> infinities and <span id="e49"></span> IP), start Challenge 1. This is one of the easier challenges. It's not faster than a normal infinity overall, but it's close. After you have <span id="e50"></span> of each generator the only generators worth buying are Generator 1 and (to a small extent) Generator 8. If you're fairly active, you might want to turn some of your autobuyers off and buy Generators 1 and 8 manually due to this. (Boosts are still worth buying though.) Also, don't sacrifice in this challenge because it's useless.</p>
  <p>Next (with <span id="e51"></span> infinities and <span id="e52"></span> IP), after infinitying in Challenge 1, start Challenge 4. This is also one of the easier challenges. This challenge doesn't have much special strategy, but you might want to wait to make a purchase of a higher generator until you can buy a few at once, since when you buy a higher generator you'll have to wait for all the ones below it to reach their previous levels again before you reach your prior star production.</p>
  <p>Next (with <span id="e53"></span> infinities and <span id="e54"></span> IP), start Challenge 3. This is only hard when you don't have any generators higher than Generator 1. However, due to the very small multiplier on Generator 1 (starting at <span id="e55"></span>), this will be the case for a few minutes at the start, which you just have to mostly wait for. Buying Generator 1 a second time for <span id="e56"></span> stars will let you get Generator 2 sooner, but buying it a third time for <span id="e57"></span> stars won't, so buy it twice and not a third time. Once you get <span id="e58"></span> stars and buy Generator 2 it should be fairly hard to even notice you're in a challenge. After you first prestige in Challenge 3, there'll be a short wait until you can get Generator 2 again, but this time it should be less than a minute. It's worth noting that overnight, you can do Challenge 3, since its increasing multiplier to Generator 1 will have the same effect as an additional <span id="e59"></span>x multiplier to all generators for every <span id="e60"></span> seconds (a bit more than a half-hour) you wait. After <span id="e61"></span> hours or so this is enough to easily get you to infinity.</p>
  <p>At this point you should have <span id="e62"></span> infinities and <span id="e63"></span> IP. Do <span id="e64"></span> more infinities not in a challenge, and save your infinity points. After this you should have <span id="e65"></span> infinities and <span id="e66"></span> infinity points. Now you can reasonably start doing slightly harder challenges.</p>
  <p>Now do Challenges 5, 8, 9, and 11. They can be done in any order without trouble, all tend to slow down later in the challenge, and don't have special strategy. After this you should have <span id="e67"></span> IP, which with you should buy the first infinity upgrade, increasing the multiplier per boost from <span id="e68"></span>x to <span id="e69"></span>x.</p>
  <p>Now you can do Challenge 6. This one could have been done slightly earlier but at the end, it gets significantly harder than 5, 8, 9, and 11 did, so it's nice to have the small advantage of slightly stronger boosts for it.</p>
  <p>The remaining <span id="e70"></span> challenges (2, 7, 10, 12) can all be done now in any order, but are all annoying in one way or another. Do the ones that sound most annoying based on the below descriptions last.</p>
  <p>Challenge 2 is slow, and doesn't speed up as much with progress as normal infinities and most challenges do. The important thing for this challenge is not to be buying things constantly, because buying almost anything resets the generator multipliers and they take a while to recover. At this point, buying things roughly every 16 seconds is good. You can do Challenge 2 far earlier if you want (buying things less frequently, maybe even only once per minute). You can do this by setting autobuyers to trigger every <span id="e71"></span> seconds, or do it manually. TLDR: this challenge is a somewhat annoying slog where you can't hold M.</p>
  <p>These descriptions are mostly not written. Also, this whole section should probably be rewritten in the form of a short description of each challenge first (including strategy), then guidelines on which to do when.</p>
